<p>Aspect ratios are critical elements in photography, although you don’t have to go that deep! Still, you are here as you understand the significance of using aspect ratios in your projects and thus are looking to find the best <strong>picture ratio calculator</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Picture-Size-Ratio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Picture-Size-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?</h2><p>As already mentioned, a picture size ratio refers to calculating or determining the Ratio of an image. And, it’s accomplished by using a<strong>picture ratio</strong> <strong>calculator</strong>. So, for example, the picture size ratio could vary from 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.</p>
<p>You can visualize this aspect ratio by allocating an image’s width and height units. For example, a 6×4 inch image has a 3:2 aspect ratio, whereas a 1920×1080 pixel video includes a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>An aspect ratio does not contain attached units—instead, it shows how large the width compared to the height, meaning that an image measured in centimeters will have the same aspect ratio even if measured in inches.</p>
<p>The relationship between its height and width decides the shape and Ratio instead of the image’s actual size.</p>
<p>Different aspect ratios consist of varying effects on the image you use. For example, an image set in a 1:1 ratio vs. a 5:4 ratio changes the composition and perception of the photo.</p>
<p><strong>Types of picture size ratios</strong></p>
<p><strong>1:1 Ratio</strong></p>

<p>Unlike aspect ratios, image size shows the actual width and height in pixels. Image size refers to the image dimensions. You can measure its dimensions in any unit, but you’ll generally see pixels used for digital or web images and inches used for print images.</p>
<p>It’s essential to note that two different images containing the same aspect ratio may not have the exact dimensions of an image. For instance, the image has 1920×1080 pixels has 16:9 aspect ratios, and an image sized at 1280×720 pixels has a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Picture-Size-Ratio-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Picture-Size-Ratio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?</h2><p>As already mentioned, a picture size ratio refers to calculating or determining the Ratio of an image. And, it’s accomplished by using a<strong>picture ratio</strong> <strong>calculator</strong>. So, for example, the picture size ratio could vary from 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.</p>
<p>You can visualize this aspect ratio by allocating an image’s width and height units. For example, a 6×4 inch image has a 3:2 aspect ratio, whereas a 1920×1080 pixel video includes a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>An aspect ratio does not contain attached units—instead, it shows how large the width compared to the height, meaning that an image measured in centimeters will have the same aspect ratio even if measured in inches.</p>
<p>The relationship between its height and width decides the shape and Ratio instead of the image’s actual size.</p>
<p>Different aspect ratios consist of varying effects on the image you use. For example, an image set in a 1:1 ratio vs. a 5:4 ratio changes the composition and perception of the photo.</p>
<p><strong>Types of picture size ratios</strong></p>
<p><strong>1:1 Ratio</strong></p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Picture-Size-Ratio-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Picture-Size-Ratio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?</h2><p>As already mentioned, a picture size ratio refers to calculating or determining the Ratio of an image. And, it’s accomplished by using a<strong>picture ratio</strong> <strong>calculator</strong>. So, for example, the picture size ratio could vary from 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.</p>
<p>You can visualize this aspect ratio by allocating an image’s width and height units. For example, a 6×4 inch image has a 3:2 aspect ratio, whereas a 1920×1080 pixel video includes a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>An aspect ratio does not contain attached units—instead, it shows how large the width compared to the height, meaning that an image measured in centimeters will have the same aspect ratio even if measured in inches.</p>
<p>The relationship between its height and width decides the shape and Ratio instead of the image’s actual size.</p>
<p>Different aspect ratios consist of varying effects on the image you use. For example, an image set in a 1:1 ratio vs. a 5:4 ratio changes the composition and perception of the photo.</p>
<p><strong>Types of picture size ratios</strong></p>
<p><strong>1:1 Ratio</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="1:1 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>A 1:1 ratio includes an image’s width and height are square and thus equal. Some standard 1:1 ratios are an 8″x8″ photo, a 1080 x 1080 pixel image generally used for mobile screens, print photographs, and social media platforms.</p>
<p><strong>3:2 Ratio</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="3:2 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 3:2 Ratio is generally 35mm film and photography and is still extensively used for prints. Images framed at 6″x4″ or 1080×720 pixels set within this aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>5:4 Ratio</strong></p>
<p><img

<p>Last but not least, this Ratio is standard in photography and art prints and photography.</p>

<p>Unlike aspect ratios, image size shows the actual width and height in pixels. Image size refers to the image dimensions. You can measure its dimensions in any unit, but you’ll generally see pixels used for digital or web images and inches used for print images.</p>
<p>It’s essential to note that two different images containing the same aspect ratio may not have the exact dimensions of an image. For instance, the image has 1920×1080 pixels has 16:9 aspect ratios, and an image sized at 1280×720 pixels has a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>

<p>The most standard aspect ratios of videos are 4:3 and 16:9. Despite these two, 9:16 and 1:1 get famous over social media platforms these days.</p>
<p>As far as you may know, various media players help you to transform the aspect ratio in real-time when playback. Yet this modification is temporary. You are required to change the aspect ratio again next time you open them.</p>
<p>But, changing the aspect ratios is pretty different than other media players. You need to launch the program and create a new project simply. But, before you do a new project, you can easily change it at the beginning panel.</p>
<p>The Filmora assists you in changing the aspect ratio of the project after downloading. Hit the drop-down tab, and you will choose the options among 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 9:16, and 21:9 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>The most standard aspect ratios of videos are 4:3 and 16:9. Despite these two, 9:16 and 1:1 get famous over social media platforms these days.</p>
<p>As far as you may know, various media players help you to transform the aspect ratio in real-time when playback. Yet this modification is temporary. You are required to change the aspect ratio again next time you open them.</p>
<p>But, changing the aspect ratios is pretty different than other media players. You need to launch the program and create a new project simply. But, before you do a new project, you can easily change it at the beginning panel.</p>
<p>The Filmora assists you in changing the aspect ratio of the project after downloading. Hit the drop-down tab, and you will choose the options among 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 9:16, and 21:9 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

                ></p>
<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

                ></p>
<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X has almost 200 different text effects that we can add, but the process of adding titles is essentially the same. Adding titles is what this article is about.</p>
<h4 id="DEFINITIONS"><a href="#DEFINITIONS" class="headerlink" title="DEFINITIONS"></a>DEFINITIONS</h4><p>Just to keep us all on the same page, here are my definitions of key terms related to text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text or titles. Words placed on the screen. I use these terms interchangeably.</li>
<li>Superimpose. Text displayed on the the screen with other video below it. These are also called “supers” or “keys.”</li>
<li>Full-screen. Text which occupies the entire screen.</li>
<li>Lower-third. Text which fits below a person talking; in the “lower-third” of the screen.</li>
<li>Info-graphics. Full-screen text which is superimposed on a graphic, generally used to convey technical information. Typical uses are sports statistics or other information which is easier to convey using text than having someone read the words.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like to introduce “Yertle,” he’s a sea turtle and the star of this article. (Footage courtesy of Jim Walker and Lobsters Gone Wild Productions.)</p>
<p>At its simplest, we use titles to display his (its?) name.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles002.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>In the Timeline, put the playhead where you want a title to appear and type Shift+Control+T. This inserts the default lower-third title at the position of the playhead. The title, like almost all titles, has a default duration of 10:00 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles003.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Look at the Browser and see the results of your work. A lower-third title is superimposed over the video in the lower left corner. (I’ll talk about formatting the text in a few paragraphs.)</p>
<p>NOTE: The big limitation of this lower-third title is that it can only be positioned in the left corner. Moving it to the center or right corner requires manual adjustment.</p>
<p>You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.</p>
<p>Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles004.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles005.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>If you look right in the center of the screen, you’ll see the word “Title.” Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.</p>
<p>Select and delete that full-screen title.</p>
<p>There’s one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles006.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Click the Title icon in the Toolbar. This displays the contents of the Title Browser. The column on the left displays title categories, the icons on the right indicate individual titles, the search box at the bottom allows you to search for specific titles by name, while the number in the lower right indicates the number of titles currently displayed. (Your number may not match mine because I’ve added a few custom titles to my system.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles007.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s add a totally ridiculous title to our turtle - drag Clouds from the Title Browser and place it above the clip at the point where you want a title to appear.</p>
<p>NOTE: I’m using a marker in the Timeline to help me find the same place in a clip so my screen shots are consistent. Markers are not needed in any way for titles.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles008.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Um, yeah. So, some titles look more professional than others… You can delete this title now.</p>
<p>So, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add titles using keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Drag titles from the Title Browser</li>
<li>Change position by dragging the title</li>
<li>Change duration by dragging the edge of the clip</li>
<li>Delete a title by selecting it and pressing the Delete key</li>

                ></p>
<p>Add a new full-screen title (type Control+T) to the Timeline. To change the text in a title, double-click it in the Viewer. Here, I’ve changed my title to “An Undersea Adventure.”</p>
<p>NOTE: We can also change the text using the Inspector. I’ll show you how in a few paragraphs. Pick whichever method is easiest for you.</p>
<p>All text, in any title, can be changed by double-clicking it in the Viewer to select it, then typing the new text you want to use.</p>

<p>You can format any text that you can select. This means that you can format entire phrases, words, or individual letters differently. For this article, I will format everything the same, because once you know how this works, you can experiment on your own.</p>
<p>Here, I selected my entire title and opened the Inspector (shortcut Cmd+4). Click the Text tab at the top. This section of the Inspector allows you to format the text.</p>
<p>NOTE: The text box near the top of the panel is the second place you can select text for formatting.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>If you want a fast way to format text, click the word “Normal” at the top. This displays a menu filled with different text formats. Some of these formats look pretty dreadful; the rest look worse.</p>
<p>NOTE: You can create your own text styles. Refer to the Help for information on how.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>The Basic section of the Inspector allows you to change fonts, size, alignment… all the standard font settings we see in other programs. Here, I’ve changed the font to Hobo Std, at 167 points.</p>
<p>While many of these settings you already know there are a few you may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line spacing. Adjusts the vertical distance between lines within the same paragraph.</li>
<li>Tracking. Adjusts the horizontal spacing between letters.</li>
<li>Baseline. Adjusts the vertical spacing of text compared to the horizontal line running thru the center of the white circle in the Viewer.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p>The Face section allows us to change font color, opacity and blue. Outline and Glow allows us to add, not surprisingly, outlines and glows. You can adjust these as you see fit - I tend not to add outlines or glows.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read. Video, even HD video, is low resolution compared to print. Drop shadows make your text much easier to read. These are the settings I recommend for drop shadows.</p>

                ></p>
<p>After making a few changes in the Inspector, here’s the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!</p>
<h4 id="ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES"><a href="#ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES" class="headerlink" title="ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES"></a>ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES</h4><p>Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.</p>
<p>While much of today’s video is designed for the web, your titles will look the best if you follow the same guidelines.</p>

<p>This displays two pale rectangles in the frame. The outer rectangle is called “Action Safe,” the inner one is called “Title Safe.” Action Safe is 5% in from all edges; Title Safe is 10% in from all edges.</p>
<p>When designing text and graphics for the web, keep all essential elements inside the outer rectangle. When designing graphics and text for broadcast or cable, keep all essential elements inside the inner rectangle.</p>
<p>Here, for example, notice that my title is fully contained within Action Safe.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X has almost 200 different text effects that we can add, but the process of adding titles is essentially the same. Adding titles is what this article is about.</p>
<h4 id="DEFINITIONS-1"><a href="#DEFINITIONS-1" class="headerlink" title="DEFINITIONS"></a>DEFINITIONS</h4><p>Just to keep us all on the same page, here are my definitions of key terms related to text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text or titles. Words placed on the screen. I use these terms interchangeably.</li>
<li>Superimpose. Text displayed on the the screen with other video below it. These are also called “supers” or “keys.”</li>
<li>Full-screen. Text which occupies the entire screen.</li>
<li>Lower-third. Text which fits below a person talking; in the “lower-third” of the screen.</li>
<li>Info-graphics. Full-screen text which is superimposed on a graphic, generally used to convey technical information. Typical uses are sports statistics or other information which is easier to convey using text than having someone read the words.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="JUST-THE-BASICS-1"><a href="#JUST-THE-BASICS-1" class="headerlink" title="JUST THE BASICS"></a>JUST THE BASICS</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles001.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>I’d like to introduce “Yertle,” he’s a sea turtle and the star of this article. (Footage courtesy of Jim Walker and Lobsters Gone Wild Productions.)</p>
<p>At its simplest, we use titles to display his (its?) name.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles002.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>In the Timeline, put the playhead where you want a title to appear and type Shift+Control+T. This inserts the default lower-third title at the position of the playhead. The title, like almost all titles, has a default duration of 10:00 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles003.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Look at the Browser and see the results of your work. A lower-third title is superimposed over the video in the lower left corner. (I’ll talk about formatting the text in a few paragraphs.)</p>
<p>NOTE: The big limitation of this lower-third title is that it can only be positioned in the left corner. Moving it to the center or right corner requires manual adjustment.</p>
<p>You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.</p>
<p>Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles004.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles005.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>If you look right in the center of the screen, you’ll see the word “Title.” Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.</p>
<p>Select and delete that full-screen title.</p>
<p>There’s one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles006.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Click the Title icon in the Toolbar. This displays the contents of the Title Browser. The column on the left displays title categories, the icons on the right indicate individual titles, the search box at the bottom allows you to search for specific titles by name, while the number in the lower right indicates the number of titles currently displayed. (Your number may not match mine because I’ve added a few custom titles to my system.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles007.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s add a totally ridiculous title to our turtle - drag Clouds from the Title Browser and place it above the clip at the point where you want a title to appear.</p>
<p>NOTE: I’m using a marker in the Timeline to help me find the same place in a clip so my screen shots are consistent. Markers are not needed in any way for titles.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles008.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Um, yeah. So, some titles look more professional than others… You can delete this title now.</p>
<p>So, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add titles using keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Drag titles from the Title Browser</li>
<li>Change position by dragging the title</li>
<li>Change duration by dragging the edge of the clip</li>
<li>Delete a title by selecting it and pressing the Delete key</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="CHANGING-TEXT-1"><a href="#CHANGING-TEXT-1" class="headerlink" title="CHANGING TEXT"></a>CHANGING TEXT</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles009.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Add a new full-screen title (type Control+T) to the Timeline. To change the text in a title, double-click it in the Viewer. Here, I’ve changed my title to “An Undersea Adventure.”</p>
<p>NOTE: We can also change the text using the Inspector. I’ll show you how in a few paragraphs. Pick whichever method is easiest for you.</p>
<p>All text, in any title, can be changed by double-clicking it in the Viewer to select it, then typing the new text you want to use.</p>
<h4 id="FORMATTING-TEXT-1"><a href="#FORMATTING-TEXT-1" class="headerlink" title="FORMATTING TEXT"></a>FORMATTING TEXT</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>You can format any text that you can select. This means that you can format entire phrases, words, or individual letters differently. For this article, I will format everything the same, because once you know how this works, you can experiment on your own.</p>
<p>Here, I selected my entire title and opened the Inspector (shortcut Cmd+4). Click the Text tab at the top. This section of the Inspector allows you to format the text.</p>
<p>NOTE: The text box near the top of the panel is the second place you can select text for formatting.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>If you want a fast way to format text, click the word “Normal” at the top. This displays a menu filled with different text formats. Some of these formats look pretty dreadful; the rest look worse.</p>
<p>NOTE: You can create your own text styles. Refer to the Help for information on how.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles012.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>The Basic section of the Inspector allows you to change fonts, size, alignment… all the standard font settings we see in other programs. Here, I’ve changed the font to Hobo Std, at 167 points.</p>
<p>While many of these settings you already know there are a few you may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line spacing. Adjusts the vertical distance between lines within the same paragraph.</li>
<li>Tracking. Adjusts the horizontal spacing between letters.</li>
<li>Baseline. Adjusts the vertical spacing of text compared to the horizontal line running thru the center of the white circle in the Viewer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles013.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>The Face section allows us to change font color, opacity and blue. Outline and Glow allows us to add, not surprisingly, outlines and glows. You can adjust these as you see fit - I tend not to add outlines or glows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles017.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read. Video, even HD video, is low resolution compared to print. Drop shadows make your text much easier to read. These are the settings I recommend for drop shadows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles014.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>After making a few changes in the Inspector, here’s the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!</p>
<h4 id="ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES-1"><a href="#ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES-1" class="headerlink" title="ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES"></a>ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES</h4><p>Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.</p>
<p>While much of today’s video is designed for the web, your titles will look the best if you follow the same guidelines.</p>
<p>Titles015</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>If you look right in the center of the screen, you’ll see the word “Title.” Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.</p>
<p>Select and delete that full-screen title.</p>
<p>There’s one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.</p>
<p><img

<p>Click the Title icon in the Toolbar. This displays the contents of the Title Browser. The column on the left displays title categories, the icons on the right indicate individual titles, the search box at the bottom allows you to search for specific titles by name, while the number in the lower right indicates the number of titles currently displayed. (Your number may not match mine because I’ve added a few custom titles to my system.)</p>

<p>Let’s add a totally ridiculous title to our turtle - drag Clouds from the Title Browser and place it above the clip at the point where you want a title to appear.</p>
<p>NOTE: I’m using a marker in the Timeline to help me find the same place in a clip so my screen shots are consistent. Markers are not needed in any way for titles.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Um, yeah. So, some titles look more professional than others… You can delete this title now.</p>
<p>So, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add titles using keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Drag titles from the Title Browser</li>
<li>Change position by dragging the title</li>

<p>Add a new full-screen title (type Control+T) to the Timeline. To change the text in a title, double-click it in the Viewer. Here, I’ve changed my title to “An Undersea Adventure.”</p>
<p>NOTE: We can also change the text using the Inspector. I’ll show you how in a few paragraphs. Pick whichever method is easiest for you.</p>
<p>All text, in any title, can be changed by double-clicking it in the Viewer to select it, then typing the new text you want to use.</p>

<p>You can format any text that you can select. This means that you can format entire phrases, words, or individual letters differently. For this article, I will format everything the same, because once you know how this works, you can experiment on your own.</p>
<p>Here, I selected my entire title and opened the Inspector (shortcut Cmd+4). Click the Text tab at the top. This section of the Inspector allows you to format the text.</p>
<p>NOTE: The text box near the top of the panel is the second place you can select text for formatting.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>If you want a fast way to format text, click the word “Normal” at the top. This displays a menu filled with different text formats. Some of these formats look pretty dreadful; the rest look worse.</p>
<p>NOTE: You can create your own text styles. Refer to the Help for information on how.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>The Basic section of the Inspector allows you to change fonts, size, alignment… all the standard font settings we see in other programs. Here, I’ve changed the font to Hobo Std, at 167 points.</p>
<p>While many of these settings you already know there are a few you may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line spacing. Adjusts the vertical distance between lines within the same paragraph.</li>
<li>Tracking. Adjusts the horizontal spacing between letters.</li>
<li>Baseline. Adjusts the vertical spacing of text compared to the horizontal line running thru the center of the white circle in the Viewer.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>The Face section allows us to change font color, opacity and blue. Outline and Glow allows us to add, not surprisingly, outlines and glows. You can adjust these as you see fit - I tend not to add outlines or glows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read. Video, even HD video, is low resolution compared to print. Drop shadows make your text much easier to read. These are the settings I recommend for drop shadows.</p>
<p><img

<p>After making a few changes in the Inspector, here’s the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!</p>
<h4 id="ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES-2"><a href="#ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES-2" class="headerlink" title="ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES"></a>ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES</h4><p>Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.</p>
<p>While much of today’s video is designed for the web, your titles will look the best if you follow the same guidelines.</p>
<p>Titles015</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles015.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Go to the Switch in the Viewer and select “Show Action Safe&#x2F;Title Safe Zones.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>This displays two pale rectangles in the frame. The outer rectangle is called “Action Safe,” the inner one is called “Title Safe.” Action Safe is 5% in from all edges; Title Safe is 10% in from all edges.</p>
<p>When designing text and graphics for the web, keep all essential elements inside the outer rectangle. When designing graphics and text for broadcast or cable, keep all essential elements inside the inner rectangle.</p>
<p>Here, for example, notice that my title is fully contained within Action Safe.</p>
<h4 id="SUMMARY-2"><a href="#SUMMARY-2" class="headerlink" title="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY</h4><p>Titles give our programs character and personality, plus they explain what’s going on to the audience. Final Cut Pro X provides a wealth of formatting options to make our text look great.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X has almost 200 different text effects that we can add, but the process of adding titles is essentially the same. Adding titles is what this article is about.</p>
<h4 id="DEFINITIONS-3"><a href="#DEFINITIONS-3" class="headerlink" title="DEFINITIONS"></a>DEFINITIONS</h4><p>Just to keep us all on the same page, here are my definitions of key terms related to text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text or titles. Words placed on the screen. I use these terms interchangeably.</li>
<li>Superimpose. Text displayed on the the screen with other video below it. These are also called “supers” or “keys.”</li>
<li>Full-screen. Text which occupies the entire screen.</li>
<li>Lower-third. Text which fits below a person talking; in the “lower-third” of the screen.</li>
<li>Info-graphics. Full-screen text which is superimposed on a graphic, generally used to convey technical information. Typical uses are sports statistics or other information which is easier to convey using text than having someone read the words.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like to introduce “Yertle,” he’s a sea turtle and the star of this article. (Footage courtesy of Jim Walker and Lobsters Gone Wild Productions.)</p>
<p>At its simplest, we use titles to display his (its?) name.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>In the Timeline, put the playhead where you want a title to appear and type Shift+Control+T. This inserts the default lower-third title at the position of the playhead. The title, like almost all titles, has a default duration of 10:00 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Look at the Browser and see the results of your work. A lower-third title is superimposed over the video in the lower left corner. (I’ll talk about formatting the text in a few paragraphs.)</p>
<p>NOTE: The big limitation of this lower-third title is that it can only be positioned in the left corner. Moving it to the center or right corner requires manual adjustment.</p>
<p>You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.</p>
<p>Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.</p>
<p><img

<p>However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read. Video, even HD video, is low resolution compared to print. Drop shadows make your text much easier to read. These are the settings I recommend for drop shadows.</p>
<p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles014.jpg"

<p>After making a few changes in the Inspector, here’s the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!</p>
<h4 id="ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES-3"><a href="#ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES-3" class="headerlink" title="ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES"></a>ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES</h4><p>Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.</p>
<p>While much of today’s video is designed for the web, your titles will look the best if you follow the same guidelines.</p>
<p>Titles015</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles015.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Go to the Switch in the Viewer and select “Show Action Safe&#x2F;Title Safe Zones.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles016.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>This displays two pale rectangles in the frame. The outer rectangle is called “Action Safe,” the inner one is called “Title Safe.” Action Safe is 5% in from all edges; Title Safe is 10% in from all edges.</p>
<p>When designing text and graphics for the web, keep all essential elements inside the outer rectangle. When designing graphics and text for broadcast or cable, keep all essential elements inside the inner rectangle.</p>
<p>Here, for example, notice that my title is fully contained within Action Safe.</p>
<h4 id="SUMMARY-3"><a href="#SUMMARY-3" class="headerlink" title="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY</h4><p>Titles give our programs character and personality, plus they explain what’s going on to the audience. Final Cut Pro X provides a wealth of formatting options to make our text look great.</p>
