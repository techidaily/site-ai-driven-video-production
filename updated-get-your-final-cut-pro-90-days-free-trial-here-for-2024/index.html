<li>Disc space: 3.8GB minimum. Need more room for FCPX? Click this.</li>

<p><strong>What Needs to be done?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you need to visit Apple’s Final Cut Pro page to download the 90days free trial version. Just make sure that your system meets the basic requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will be asked to enter your first and last name along with your email address. Please fill in all the details. After that, click on the blue tab that says download free trial. The total size will be 2.7GB.</li>

Well, if that’s happening, there could be a few reasons which are highlighted below.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Poor Internet Connection</strong></p>
<p>The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won’t be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.</p>
<p><strong>Check System Requirements</strong></p>
<p>To download the Final Cut Pro free trial version, your Mac system has to meet Apple’s minimum requirements. Even if one of the requirements fails to meet, you won’t be able to download Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial. To try the latest version, the OS has to be 10.15.6 or later. Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement. If the OS is not updated, update it before trying to download the package.</p>
<p><strong>Try Using Another Account</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.</p>
<p><strong>Quit and Restart your System</strong></p>
<p>If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.</p>
<p><strong>Disconnect External Devices</strong></p>
<p>If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-reset-the-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-before-it-expires"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-reset-the-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-before-it-expires" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?"></a>Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?</h2><p> Final Cut Pro free trial version will be over after 90 days because that’s their policy. Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.</p>
<p> <img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="trial-expire"
                ></p>
<p>Code to reset Final Cut Pro 10.4.4</p>
<p> #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;swift</p>
<p> import Foundation</p>
<p> let path &#x3D; URL(fileURLWithPath: NSString(string: “~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;.ffuserdata”).expandingTildeInPath)</p>
<p> let data &#x3D; try! NSData(contentsOf: path) as Data</p>
<p> let dictionary &#x3D; try! NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(data) as! NSDictionary</p>
<p> let mutableDictionary &#x3D; dictionary.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableDictionary</p>
<p> for (key, value) in mutableDictionary {</p>
<p> if value is NSDate {</p>
<p> mutableDictionary[key] &#x3D; Date()</p>
<p> }</p>
<p> }</p>
<p> try! NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: mutableDictionary, requiringSecureCoding: false).write(to: path)</p>
<p> print(“You’d better buy it”)</p>
<p> It’s quite complicated that you will have to enter this code manually into the terminal each time the trial expires. Regrettably, there is no way to extend the free trial permanently, so you will have to repeat this part over and over again.</p>
<p>But to be aware, this may lead to a ban or other punishment to your account by Apple Inc.</p>
<p>Anyway, it makes sense why people want to stick to their free trial! Final Cut Pro is not an affordable video editing tool.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-FAQ"><a href="#Part-4-FAQ" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQ"></a>Part 4: FAQ</h2><p><strong>What is the limitation of the trial version of FCPX?</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro Additional Content, which includes over 1300 royalty-free sound effects for use in your projects, isn’t available in the Final Cut Pro trial. The trial is fully functional otherwise.</p>
<p>You can import media, edit, organize, add effects, color correct, export files in a variety of professional formats, and more. Get an overview of Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Is Final Cut Pro worth the price?</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro comes with robust video editing features, which can help you create stunning and professional-level videos. However, Final Cut Pro is not for beginners, and if $299 is a little too expensive for you, it is better to find another video editing tool that won’t cost you this much and will let you create professional-looking videos effortlessly. This is when Filmora by Wondershare comes into play.</p>

Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.</p>

<p><strong>The Basic Requirements to Get Final Cut Pro</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OS requirement: macOS 10.15.6 or later.</li>
<li>Disc space: 3.8GB minimum. Need more room for FCPX? Click this.</li>
<li>RAM: 4GB for basic editing. But if you want to do 360o editing, it’s better to have 8GB RAM with 1GB of VRAM.</li>
<li>Graphics card: Metal-capable.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>What Needs to be done?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you need to visit Apple’s Final Cut Pro page to download the 90days free trial version. Just make sure that your system meets the basic requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will be asked to enter your first and last name along with your email address. Please fill in all the details. After that, click on the blue tab that says download free trial. The total size will be 2.7GB.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Let the .dmg file get downloaded. After that, you will have to double-click the installer package to start the installation process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once done, you are all set to use the free trial of Final Cut Pro for 90 days. After the free trial ends, you will have to pay for the video editing software to continue using it.</p>
<p>There will be some limitations, though. For example, you will not be able to try the additional effects. Unfortunately, this means that even if the trial version has been extended, you will still miss out on some of the advanced features if you don’t pay.</p>
<p>For those who already try out Final Cut Pro and are happy with the editor, you can see how to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >save money with the education bundle of Apple. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

Well, if that’s happening, there could be a few reasons which are highlighted below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Poor Internet Connection</strong></p>
<p>The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won’t be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.</p>
<p><strong>Check System Requirements</strong></p>
<p>To download the Final Cut Pro free trial version, your Mac system has to meet Apple’s minimum requirements. Even if one of the requirements fails to meet, you won’t be able to download Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial. To try the latest version, the OS has to be 10.15.6 or later. Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement. If the OS is not updated, update it before trying to download the package.</p>
<p><strong>Try Using Another Account</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.</p>
<p><strong>Quit and Restart your System</strong></p>
<p>If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.</p>
<p><strong>Disconnect External Devices</strong></p>
<p>If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.</p>

<p><strong>The Basic Requirements to Get Final Cut Pro</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OS requirement: macOS 10.15.6 or later.</li>
<li>Disc space: 3.8GB minimum. Need more room for FCPX? Click this.</li>
<li>RAM: 4GB for basic editing. But if you want to do 360o editing, it’s better to have 8GB RAM with 1GB of VRAM.</li>
<li>Graphics card: Metal-capable.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="fcpx-mac-store"
                ></p>
<p><strong>What Needs to be done?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you need to visit Apple’s Final Cut Pro page to download the 90days free trial version. Just make sure that your system meets the basic requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will be asked to enter your first and last name along with your email address. Please fill in all the details. After that, click on the blue tab that says download free trial. The total size will be 2.7GB.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Let the .dmg file get downloaded. After that, you will have to double-click the installer package to start the installation process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once done, you are all set to use the free trial of Final Cut Pro for 90 days. After the free trial ends, you will have to pay for the video editing software to continue using it.</p>
<p>There will be some limitations, though. For example, you will not be able to try the additional effects. Unfortunately, this means that even if the trial version has been extended, you will still miss out on some of the advanced features if you don’t pay.</p>
<p>For those who already try out Final Cut Pro and are happy with the editor, you can see how to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >save money with the education bundle of Apple. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-won’t-open-3"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-won’t-open-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Final Cut Pro trial won’t open?"></a>Part 2: Why Final Cut Pro trial won’t open?</h2><p> Although there shouldn’t be any issue in downloading the Final Cut Pro trial version, if you meet your system’s requirements, some customers are complaining that they can’t download or install the Final Cur Pro trial package. Well, if that’s happening, there could be a few reasons which are highlighted below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fcpx-in-mac"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Poor Internet Connection</strong></p>
<p>The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won’t be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.</p>
<p><strong>Check System Requirements</strong></p>
<p>To download the Final Cut Pro free trial version, your Mac system has to meet Apple’s minimum requirements. Even if one of the requirements fails to meet, you won’t be able to download Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial. To try the latest version, the OS has to be 10.15.6 or later. Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement. If the OS is not updated, update it before trying to download the package.</p>
<p><strong>Try Using Another Account</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.</p>
<p><strong>Quit and Restart your System</strong></p>
<p>If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.</p>
<p><strong>Disconnect External Devices</strong></p>
<p>If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-reset-the-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-before-it-expires-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-reset-the-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-before-it-expires-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?"></a>Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?</h2><p> Final Cut Pro free trial version will be over after 90 days because that’s their policy. Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="trial-expire"
                ></p>
<p>Code to reset Final Cut Pro 10.4.4</p>
<p> #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;swift</p>
<p> import Foundation</p>
<p> let path &#x3D; URL(fileURLWithPath: NSString(string: “~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;.ffuserdata”).expandingTildeInPath)</p>
<p> let data &#x3D; try! NSData(contentsOf: path) as Data</p>
<p> let dictionary &#x3D; try! NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(data) as! NSDictionary</p>
<p> let mutableDictionary &#x3D; dictionary.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableDictionary</p>
<p> for (key, value) in mutableDictionary {</p>
<p> if value is NSDate {</p>
<p> mutableDictionary[key] &#x3D; Date()</p>
<p> }</p>
<p> }</p>
<p> try! NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: mutableDictionary, requiringSecureCoding: false).write(to: path)</p>
<p> print(“You’d better buy it”)</p>
<p> It’s quite complicated that you will have to enter this code manually into the terminal each time the trial expires. Regrettably, there is no way to extend the free trial permanently, so you will have to repeat this part over and over again.</p>
<p>But to be aware, this may lead to a ban or other punishment to your account by Apple Inc.</p>
<p>Anyway, it makes sense why people want to stick to their free trial! Final Cut Pro is not an affordable video editing tool.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro Additional Content, which includes over 1300 royalty-free sound effects for use in your projects, isn’t available in the Final Cut Pro trial. The trial is fully functional otherwise.</p>
<p>You can import media, edit, organize, add effects, color correct, export files in a variety of professional formats, and more. Get an overview of Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Is Final Cut Pro worth the price?</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro comes with robust video editing features, which can help you create stunning and professional-level videos. However, Final Cut Pro is not for beginners, and if $299 is a little too expensive for you, it is better to find another video editing tool that won’t cost you this much and will let you create professional-looking videos effortlessly. This is when Filmora by Wondershare comes into play.</p>

<h5 id="Liza-Brown-4"><a href="#Liza-Brown-4" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p> Instagram’s announcement that the stop motion feature will become available in the Stories section created quite a buzz on the Internet, a while ago. In 2020, the feature remains relatively unknown to social media users, even though on paper it seemed promising.</p>
<p> Stop motion videos, are simply sequentially taken photos that create an illusion of movement once they are played one after the other. These <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >types of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are growing more popular on social media, as they can make Instagram stories or any other social media feed more interesting. You are at the right place if you would like to join video content creators who already <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >produce stop motion videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because in this article we are going to show you how to make a stop motion video on Instagram.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Video-on-Instagram"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Video-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Make a Stop Motion Video on Instagram?"></a>Part 1: How to Make a Stop Motion Video on Instagram?</h2><p> The technical side of making a stop motion video on Instagram is rather simple since you can enable this feature in just a few taps. After you launch the app, you should tap on the <strong>Camera</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the screen. The new window will open where you can choose the type of Instagram story you want to create, so you can pick to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >go live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, record a video normally or use the app’s Boomerang feature.</p>
<p> You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.</p>
<p> Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten. Tap on the Done button that is located at the top of the screen once you completed the process of making a stop motion video and then proceed to choose stickers you would like to include in the story you created. Press the Send To button and decide if you want to share the stop motion video to your Instagram or Facebook story or with some of your Instagram followers. ;</p>

<p> Like all other Instagram stories, stop motion videos created with this app are only available for 24 hours if you don’t save them on your phone. Moreover, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >downloading the stories you create with Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’s stop motion tool will enable you to edit them with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing apps for iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Android devices and post them to any social media platform you choose.</p>
<p> In addition, the maximum number of frames a stop motion video created with Instagram can have is limited to just ten.</p>

If the issue persists, you should opt for some other stop motion app you can use free of charge. ;</p>

With so many different options on the market, finding the app that provides you with all features you need to create stop motion videos can be a difficult task. That’s why we shortlisted the three best apps for iPhones and Android devices that enable you to make animated stop motion videos for Instagram.</p>
<h3 id="1-Over"><a href="#1-Over" class="headerlink" title="1. Over"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.madewithover.com/" >Over <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, offers in-app purchase</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android</p>
<p> Over allows you to do much more than just create stop motion videos you can post on Instagram since it is equipped with a versatile set of tools that can help you improve the brand awareness on social media.

However, the free version of the app offers only limited capabilities, and you must upgrade to the Pro version if you want to have access to all photo and video editing tools Over have to offer.</p>

<p> Creating content for social media with Mojo is a simple process that can be completed in just three easy steps. You don’t even need a Mojo account to start creating stories with this app. All you have to do is select an animated template, import videos or photos and edit it before tapping on the share button. There are more than a hundred animated templates to choose from, so after you pick one, you just have to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add text overlays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but you must purchase Mojo Pro if you want to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >change aspect ratios <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, duplicate stories or have access to all text styles and templates.</p>

<p> The fact that more than a million video content creators and brands are using Life Lapse to make stop motion videos says a lot about the app’s capabilities. Unlike Over and Mojo, Life Lapse lets you set the exposure and focus locks, switch on a grid or use the ghosted image overlay. Besides capturing photos and videos, the app also allows you to import photos you want to include in the stop motion animation.

Besides capturing photos and videos, the app also allows you to import photos you want to include in the stop motion animation. Furthermore, even the free version of Life Lapse offers a variety of video editing tools that allow you to crop images or adjust saturation, brightness or white balance values in each frame.</p>

<p> The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds.

<p> Instagram’s announcement that the stop motion feature will become available in the Stories section created quite a buzz on the Internet, a while ago. In 2020, the feature remains relatively unknown to social media users, even though on paper it seemed promising.</p>
<p> Stop motion videos, are simply sequentially taken photos that create an illusion of movement once they are played one after the other. These <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >types of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are growing more popular on social media, as they can make Instagram stories or any other social media feed more interesting. You are at the right place if you would like to join video content creators who already <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >produce stop motion videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because in this article we are going to show you how to make a stop motion video on Instagram.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Video-on-Instagram-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Video-on-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Make a Stop Motion Video on Instagram?"></a>Part 1: How to Make a Stop Motion Video on Instagram?</h2><p> The technical side of making a stop motion video on Instagram is rather simple since you can enable this feature in just a few taps. After you launch the app, you should tap on the <strong>Camera</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the screen. The new window will open where you can choose the type of Instagram story you want to create, so you can pick to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >go live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, record a video normally or use the app’s Boomerang feature.</p>
<p> You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.</p>
<p> Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten. Tap on the Done button that is located at the top of the screen once you completed the process of making a stop motion video and then proceed to choose stickers you would like to include in the story you created. Press the Send To button and decide if you want to share the stop motion video to your Instagram or Facebook story or with some of your Instagram followers. ;</p>

<p> Like all other Instagram stories, stop motion videos created with this app are only available for 24 hours if you don’t save them on your phone. Moreover, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >downloading the stories you create with Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’s stop motion tool will enable you to edit them with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing apps for iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Android devices and post them to any social media platform you choose.</p>
<p> In addition, the maximum number of frames a stop motion video created with Instagram can have is limited to just ten.</p>

If the issue persists, you should opt for some other stop motion app you can use free of charge. ;</p>
