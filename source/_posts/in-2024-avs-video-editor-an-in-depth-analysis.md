Now, is there any Premiere transition you like? If you have picked one, now let's to add it to Premiere Pro. Here are few easy to follow steps for your Premiere Pro transition effects.

### Step 1: Go to Effects panel

Go to Premiere Pro interface and select **Effects** panel from available options. Now from the available transition folders, pick the one that suits your project editing needs. The types of numbers of transitions available in effects panel will depend upon the version of Premiere Pro that you have installed in your system. Some of the most common transition effects are listed below:

* **Zoom:** Zoom transition helps to work on a selected potion of screen and it brings scene in or out in a selected proportion from whole screen.
* **Slide:** In this sliding motion type transition effect, one scene floats over another.
* **Wipe:** This one is quite interesting where one shot complete replaces the selected another shot while travelling from one portion of the frame to another.
* **Iris:** The iris transition effect is a newer one where an artificial effect is created to reflect the actual opening and closing motion of camera iris during shooting.
* **3D Motion:** Such type of transition effects tries to manipulate selected clips in the space. For instance, if you apply flip over transition in this 3D motion category then one clip will simply flip over screen in such a manner that secondary clip below it gets revealed in appealing manner.
* **Dissolve:** In this type of transition effect, one scene completely melds into another scene. You can describe such type of blends with terms like fade out and fade in from or to a bank image.

Effects folders usually contain stylistically similar kind of transitions, but the result different appearances are on screen.
