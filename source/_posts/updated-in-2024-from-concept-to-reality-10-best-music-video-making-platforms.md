Movie creator: [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) has a user-friendly and intuitive interface as well as plentiful features. **This software enables you to create custom movies with pictures, music and effects.** You can then watch the movie on your Mac, share with friends or family members, post it on a social networking site or burn it to a DVD.

For the detailed information about How to import media files to Filmora for Mac, check our [Import your media files guide here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 2. Start making your movie

Now it's time to take your movie to the next level by adding personalizing and special touches, such as intro/credit, transitions and effects.

 **Intro/credit:**  just like you see in movie theaters and on DVDs, you may want to add an intro at the beginning of your movie that tells people a little bit about your movie and add credits at the end to tell the world who created and starred in it.

Filmora for Mac allows you to caption with more than **200 titles and text styles** with or without animation. To do this, just switch to the Intro/Credit tab and drag the effects to the place where you want it to appear. Then double click and go to “Title” to enter your words or change the Font, Size, and Color of the texts.
