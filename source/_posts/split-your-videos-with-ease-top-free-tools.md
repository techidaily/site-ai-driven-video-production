To use Lightworks as **split screen video maker**, you can follow the instructions given below:

**Step 1: Add Tracks in Timeline**

After importing the clips to Lightworks, leave them in the **Media Bin** for now, right-click anywhere in the Timeline at the bottom, go to **Tracks**, click **Add multiple**, and from the **Number to add** drop-down list, choose the number of tracks you want to add to the Timeline.
