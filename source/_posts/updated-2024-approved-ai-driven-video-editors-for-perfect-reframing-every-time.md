## **Final Verdict**

VN Video Editor is a mobile-based video editing app. It is an easy and powerful tool to edit all kinds of videos, especially with HD quality. With it, you can trim, crop, merge and rotate your photos, add watermarks, and so much more for both Android and IOS users. However, it does not support some advanced video editing features.
