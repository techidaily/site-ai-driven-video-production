### 1\.  TikTok

**Available for:** Android, iOS, iPad

[TikTok](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok-make-your-day/id835599320) is a Chinese video-making and sharing social networking application used to create short dances, lip syncs, comedy and talent recordings, and much more. The introduction of the reaction feature in Tiktok enables the users to make and share their opinions about a particular event without leaving the application, therefore attracting more users even from other social media platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

To record a reaction, you can begin playing the video, tap the **Share** icon to open the menu and tap the **React** option. With this, Tiktok presents you with a video creation screen that allows you to add audio, change the position of the reaction box, and then record a video using your smartphone’s rear or front camera. You can add filters and [edit the volume level](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and then publish your reaction to the platform as needed.

**Pros**

* TikTok is free to use
* The app is available for both iOS and Android platforms

**Cons**

* Doesn’t allow videos that are of more than 60 seconds for normal users
* Limited in monetizing currently

### 2\.  iMovie

**Available for:** iOS, iPad and macOS

Developed by and proprietary of Apple Inc., [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193) is a simple post-production program for amateurs, and in some cases, even for [professional video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The software is available for both Mac computers and iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad and has almost all the features and functions required to edit and manipulate the videos to bring the best out of them.

Although not particularly a reaction video maker app, iMovie can be used to create plenty of them by recording your footage on your smartphone, downloading the source videos from TikTok, transferring both the clips to your Mac computer with iMovie installed (or installing iMovie on your iOS device if you are OK comfortable with the version), doing some basic editing tasks, downloading and importing the pre-keyed effects, adding them to your reaction project, and then exporting the final reaction in your preferred format.

**Pros**

* iMovie is a free program and can be downloaded from the App Store on your Mac computer or iPhone/iPad

**Cons**

* Not a full-fledged post-production program with all the robust features to work with.

### 3\.  Reaction & Screen Recorder

**Available for:** iOS

Designed by the employees of Spotify, [Reaction & Screen Recorder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reaction-cam/id1225289579) allows you to create reaction videos on iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad. In addition to this, the app even enables you to edit their recording with its built-in video editor.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Furthermore, equipped with all the interesting features, this mobile app lets you react to YouTube video, screen recordings of games, Facebook and Instagram videos, websites, online photos, and even to TikTok and other footage on your smartphone. Apart from this, you can pause and [rewind clips](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and record commentary videos as well.

**Pros**

* Fast rendering process
* Inbuilt effects and transitions

**Cons**

* Available exclusively for iOS platforms
* You have to purchase the software in order to remove ads, pause/rewind, resize

### 4\.  iReact - Reaction Videos

**Available for:** iOS

If you are starting a YouTube channel and want to make reaction videos, [iReact](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ireact-reaction-videos/id1378116354) would be your best bet. With a simple interface and powerful editing features, iReact is the only reaction video app you need to create high-resolution feedbacks on the go.

![Make Reaction Video with iReact](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ireact-app-making-reaction-video.jpg)

The program lets you choose random footage from the Camera Roll to react on. You can even react to any online video by entering its URL. With iReact, you can record intros as well where the app lets you capture self-introduction before the actual clip. This structure is widely popular among the YouTube community.

As an added advantage, options like replay, pause, resume, rewind, and [fast-forward](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) come in handy as you can perform all these tasks while the camera records your reaction. Post capturing, you can also add music to your creations. Many people from various video-sharing platforms use iReact as it is a widely popular reaction video maker app among iOS users across the globe.

**Pros**

* Users can resize and reposition the videos
* Users can share their videos to their social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram, etc.
