![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

* Low-quality and old video restoration

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-22.jpg)

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.
