## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

GIFs are basically soundless picture collections that have been modified to resemble a video. On the other hand, videos are gathered as a kind of rich media that includes both motion and sound. What's more, the viewing experiences for these two file kinds are somewhat different.

## But why would someone want to convert a video to a GIF, to begin with? There are several explanations for this

## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

GIFs are basically soundless picture collections that have been modified to resemble a video. On the other hand, videos are gathered as a kind of rich media that includes both motion and sound. What's more, the viewing experiences for these two file kinds are somewhat different.

## But why would someone want to convert a video to a GIF, to begin with? There are several explanations for this

### Choosing software to save a video as a GIF

All operating systems have a way to convert video to GIF, as you can see in this article. All you have to do now is choose the right one. In a nutshell, here's how you choose the right platform for your GIFs:

**Usability:**The video to GIF platform you use should be simple to use. You want a high-performance converter that's also simple to use.

**Tools:** The platform should have all of the tools you'll need to make an intriguing GIF, such as speed modification, filters, subtitles, and more.

**Quality:** To avoid pixelation, your platform must be able to make GIFs with a high resolution.
