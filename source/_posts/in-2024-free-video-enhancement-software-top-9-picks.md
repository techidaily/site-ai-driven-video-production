Videos you record with your iPhone, iPad or any other camera can often be larger than 1GB, especially if they were captured in high resolution.

The free version of Clipchamp will **watermark video you compressed at the beginning and ending frames**, and if you want to [remove the watermark from a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you have to upgrade to the Business version of the video editor.
