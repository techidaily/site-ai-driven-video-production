## Part 1: What is the Bokeh Effect and Why Should I Be Using it?

The word “Bokeh”or “boke” refers to the Japanese concept of “blur.” It is, in its simplest form, a style of photography where one object is the primary focus, and everything else is strategically blurred.

Using the Bokeh effect is an excellent way to separate the focal point of your photo from non-focal points. It not only serves the purpose of highlighting the focus of the image, but can also help when you’re looking to get rid of an unpleasant or unwanted background. The blurred background is meant to keep your focal point at the absolute center of your audience’s attention.

## Part 2: Top 10 Best Apps to Achieve the Bokeh Effect for iOS and Android

As mentioned, there are other ways to achieve the Bokeh effect without an expensive and often fidget DSLR camera. The following apps have been deemed the best based on a variety of characteristics which will be mentioned below.

### 1. Focos -[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focos/id1274938524) \- FREE

The Focos app for iPhones is a free resource that uses computational photography and light-field camera settings to help you achieve the perfect blur. It offers users the option to apply the Bokeh effect to both the background and foreground of your image, with a variety of options for adjusting size and transparency.

To create the Bokeh effect in Focos:

1. Download App via App Store and allow it access to your camera and camera roll;
2. Import the image you wish you use, or take a photo using the app’s camera;
3. Adjust your focal point and transparency of the blur using their sliding bar feature;

It not only serves the purpose of highlighting the focus of the image, but can also help when you’re looking to get rid of an unpleasant or unwanted background. The blurred background is meant to keep your focal point at the absolute center of your audience’s attention.

It not only serves the purpose of highlighting the focus of the image, but can also help when you’re looking to get rid of an unpleasant or unwanted background. The blurred background is meant to keep your focal point at the absolute center of your audience’s attention.
