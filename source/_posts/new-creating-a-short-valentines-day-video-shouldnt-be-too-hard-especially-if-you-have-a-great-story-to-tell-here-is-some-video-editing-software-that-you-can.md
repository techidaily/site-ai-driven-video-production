Finding ways to show your feelings isn’t always easy. In fact, [buying presents](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for those you care about the most, won’t necessarily reflect how you feel, so this year you can try making something for them.

**Creating a short Valentine’s Day video** shouldn’t be too hard, especially if you have a great story to tell. Besides, a video is something that will last, and your significant other will always be able to watch it no matter what the future brings. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to make a Valentine’s Day video on your Windows PC or Mac, or just with your mobile phones that will truly show how you feel.

## How to Make a Valentine’s Day Video on Windows and Mac

There are hundreds of [video editing software for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Mac computers you can use to create a Valentine’s Day video, but in this article, we are going to use Filmora as an example. However, each of the steps we will cover can be used in other video editors for Mac and Windows. Let’s check how to make a Valentine’s Day video with Filmora.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 1\. It all starts with an Idea

Creating any type of video without having a well-developed idea is virtually impossible because you won’t know which footage to use. Moreover, having an idea of how you want the final draft of the video to look will make it easier for you to select the footage you intend to use during the video editing process.

Once you know exactly what you want to do you can start shooting or collecting the footage you are going to include in your Valentine’s Day video. After you have all the video files you need, place them in one folder, launch Filmora, create a new project and proceed to import the footage by dragging and dropping the files to the editor’s Media tab.

### 2\. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors

During the next step, you should add all video clips you would like to use in your video to the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging a particular video file from the Media tab and dropping it to the desired location on the timeline.

![ Drag and drop valentines video footage to Filmora ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-n-drop-timeline.jpg)

Optionally, you can use the Split tool to make cuts in a video clip and [remove parts you don’t want to include in the final version of the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). When done, you should right-click on each of the video clips you added to the timeline and select [the Color Correction](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) option. You can then proceed to fine-tune the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, or Highlights values depending on how bright or vivid the colors in the original video are. This process can take a while, which is why it is important to be patient and go through it slowly.

### 3\. Add Romantic Filters and Elements

Filmora features Effects and Elements libraries that contain hundreds of different image overlays, filters, and predesigned elements you can add to your project. You just need to click on the Effect or Elements icons in the upper right corner of the screen to start browsing these libraries.

![ Drag and drop valentines element to video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-elements.jpg)

Once you find a romantic filter or element you want to apply to your footage, you should simply drag and drop it to the video track that is located directly above the one on which your footage is located. You should then position an [overlay, a filter, or an element](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at the exact spot where you want them to appear in your video.

![ Drag and drop valentines transitions  to video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-transitions.jpg)

In case you want to adjust the intensity of an effect you applied you should just double-click on it and then use the Alpha slider to adjust the effect’s intensity. Double-clicking on an element you placed on the timeline will grant you access to the Video tab where you can rotate it, change its on-screen position, or set its Opacity value.

### 4\. Apply Text Layers

The Titles tab contains more than a hundred different Openers, End Credits, or Titles options you can use in all of your projects. Simply pick the one that best matches the style of your video, then add it to the timeline and double-click on it in order to start customizing it.

![ Drag and drop valentines texts and titles  to video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-titles.jpg)

Once you [insert the text](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can pick the font, color, or this size of the text, as well as set the spacing between two lines of text. Optionally, you can use Filmora’s Advanced Text Edit window if you want to have complete control over all layers of text you add to your video.

### 5\. Create the Soundtrack

Music will give your video the rhythm and it will make it more entertaining to watch, which is the reason why you shouldn’t skip this step. In case, you already have an audio file you would like to use as a soundtrack for your Valentine’s Day video, you can import it into Fimora the same way you would import a video file. You can then add it to an audio track and adjust its duration so that it matches the duration of the entire video.

![ add music for valentines video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-audio-library.jpg)

You can also use Filmora’s library of [royalty-free songs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create the soundtrack for the video you are making. Just head over to the Audio tab, pick a song from Electronic, Rock, or Tender & Sentimental categories, and add it to the timeline.

### 6\. Export the Video

When done with all these steps, you should preview the video you’ve created and if you like the results click on the Export button. You can then proceed to select the video format in which your video is going to be exported, choose the preferred resolution or the [frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Furthermore, Filmora lets you export all videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channels, which can save you a lot of time on uploading videos to these video hosting platforms. Nonetheless, how long the rendering process is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power.

## Creating Videos with Valentine Video Maker for Android

If you find the process of making a Valentine’s Day video on Mac and Windows computers a bit too technical, then an app like [Valentine Video Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sigmaappsolution.valentinevideomaker&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) that lets you edit photos and videos from your Android phone is the perfect option for you.

![Valentines Video Makers App for Android ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/valentine-video-maker-app-android.jpg)

Creating slow motion or fast forward videos is yet another option you’ll have at your disposal if you choose to edit your videos with this app. The best part is that you can create a new video with Valentine Video Maker in just a few minutes and share it on social media.

## Using Valentines Video Greetings Maker on iPhones

Even though there are lots of different video editing apps for iPhones, very few of them enable their users to create customized Valentine’s Day messages. So if you would like to surprise the person you love with a beautiful Valentine’s Day message, you should install [Valentines Video Greetings Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/valentines-greetings-maker/id804531269) on your iPhone.

![Valentines Video Makers App for iPhone ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-greetings-maker-ios-app.jpg)

Finding ways to show your feelings isn’t always easy. In fact, [buying presents](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for those you care about the most, won’t necessarily reflect how you feel, so this year you can try making something for them.

**Creating a short Valentine’s Day video** shouldn’t be too hard, especially if you have a great story to tell. Besides, a video is something that will last, and your significant other will always be able to watch it no matter what the future brings. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to make a Valentine’s Day video on your Windows PC or Mac, or just with your mobile phones that will truly show how you feel.

## How to Make a Valentine’s Day Video on Windows and Mac

There are hundreds of [video editing software for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Mac computers you can use to create a Valentine’s Day video, but in this article, we are going to use Filmora as an example. However, each of the steps we will cover can be used in other video editors for Mac and Windows. Let’s check how to make a Valentine’s Day video with Filmora.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 1\. It all starts with an Idea

Creating any type of video without having a well-developed idea is virtually impossible because you won’t know which footage to use. Moreover, having an idea of how you want the final draft of the video to look will make it easier for you to select the footage you intend to use during the video editing process.

Once you know exactly what you want to do you can start shooting or collecting the footage you are going to include in your Valentine’s Day video. After you have all the video files you need, place them in one folder, launch Filmora, create a new project and proceed to import the footage by dragging and dropping the files to the editor’s Media tab.

### 2\. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors

During the next step, you should add all video clips you would like to use in your video to the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging a particular video file from the Media tab and dropping it to the desired location on the timeline.

![ Drag and drop valentines video footage to Filmora ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-n-drop-timeline.jpg)

Optionally, you can use the Split tool to make cuts in a video clip and [remove parts you don’t want to include in the final version of the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). When done, you should right-click on each of the video clips you added to the timeline and select [the Color Correction](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) option. You can then proceed to fine-tune the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, or Highlights values depending on how bright or vivid the colors in the original video are. This process can take a while, which is why it is important to be patient and go through it slowly.

### 3\. Add Romantic Filters and Elements

Filmora features Effects and Elements libraries that contain hundreds of different image overlays, filters, and predesigned elements you can add to your project. You just need to click on the Effect or Elements icons in the upper right corner of the screen to start browsing these libraries.

![ Drag and drop valentines element to video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-elements.jpg)

Once you find a romantic filter or element you want to apply to your footage, you should simply drag and drop it to the video track that is located directly above the one on which your footage is located. You should then position an [overlay, a filter, or an element](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at the exact spot where you want them to appear in your video.

![ Drag and drop valentines transitions  to video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-transitions.jpg)

In case you want to adjust the intensity of an effect you applied you should just double-click on it and then use the Alpha slider to adjust the effect’s intensity. Double-clicking on an element you placed on the timeline will grant you access to the Video tab where you can rotate it, change its on-screen position, or set its Opacity value.

### 4\. Apply Text Layers

The Titles tab contains more than a hundred different Openers, End Credits, or Titles options you can use in all of your projects. Simply pick the one that best matches the style of your video, then add it to the timeline and double-click on it in order to start customizing it.

![ Drag and drop valentines texts and titles  to video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-titles.jpg)

Once you [insert the text](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can pick the font, color, or this size of the text, as well as set the spacing between two lines of text. Optionally, you can use Filmora’s Advanced Text Edit window if you want to have complete control over all layers of text you add to your video.

### 5\. Create the Soundtrack

Music will give your video the rhythm and it will make it more entertaining to watch, which is the reason why you shouldn’t skip this step. In case, you already have an audio file you would like to use as a soundtrack for your Valentine’s Day video, you can import it into Fimora the same way you would import a video file. You can then add it to an audio track and adjust its duration so that it matches the duration of the entire video.

![ add music for valentines video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-audio-library.jpg)

You can also use Filmora’s library of [royalty-free songs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create the soundtrack for the video you are making. Just head over to the Audio tab, pick a song from Electronic, Rock, or Tender & Sentimental categories, and add it to the timeline.

### 6\. Export the Video

When done with all these steps, you should preview the video you’ve created and if you like the results click on the Export button. You can then proceed to select the video format in which your video is going to be exported, choose the preferred resolution or the [frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Furthermore, Filmora lets you export all videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channels, which can save you a lot of time on uploading videos to these video hosting platforms. Nonetheless, how long the rendering process is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power.

## Creating Videos with Valentine Video Maker for Android

If you find the process of making a Valentine’s Day video on Mac and Windows computers a bit too technical, then an app like [Valentine Video Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sigmaappsolution.valentinevideomaker&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) that lets you edit photos and videos from your Android phone is the perfect option for you. You can install the app for free and use its video editing tools to combine photos and video clips into a captivating Valentine’s Day video.

![Valentines Video Makers App for Android ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/valentine-video-maker-app-android.jpg)

Creating slow motion or fast forward videos is yet another option you’ll have at your disposal if you choose to edit your videos with this app. The best part is that you can create a new video with Valentine Video Maker in just a few minutes and share it on social media.

## Using Valentines Video Greetings Maker on iPhones

Even though there are lots of different video editing apps for iPhones, very few of them enable their users to create customized Valentine’s Day messages. So if you would like to surprise the person you love with a beautiful Valentine’s Day message, you should install [Valentines Video Greetings Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/valentines-greetings-maker/id804531269) on your iPhone.

![Valentines Video Makers App for iPhone ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-greetings-maker-ios-app.jpg)

The app lets you combine an unlimited number of images or videos and record your own customized voice message to accompany the video you created. Each video greeting you create can be shared on social media with a single tap or sent directly via email. Keep in mind that you must make an in-app purchase in order to be able to save your video greetings to the Photo Gallery.

**Conclusion**

Making something special for the person you love is going to make this year’s Valentine’s Day a day to remember. All you need to accomplish this is a video editing software like Filmora and a great idea for a Valentine’s Day video.

## Get Creative with These Top Vignette Apps for Mobile Phones

# 10 Best Vignette Apps in 2024 \[iOS & Android\]

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Sharing unedited photos and videos on your social media accounts can negatively reflect on the number of views and like your posts are getting. You don’t necessarily have to know a lot about photo or video editing process in order to add a vignette to a picture or adjust its color, brightness or highlights. As a matter of fact, all you need is a great app that lets you emphasize the center of the image and darken its edges. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best vignette apps for iPhones and Android devices that make the vignetting process fun.

## Top 10 Vignette Apps in 2024 \[Free & Paid\]

Vignettes can be used to make your selfies look more artistic or to increase the contrast between the edges and the center of a landscape photo. Even though you can use vignetting in any type of photo or video, it is still advisable to carefully choose the images to which you’d like to add this effect, since the results you’re going to get depend mostly on the quality of the original footage. Here are the ten best vignette apps in 2019.

#### 1. [Apple Photos App](https://support.apple.com/photos)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS

iPhone users can edit their photos with the built-in Photos app that offers a variety of photo and video shooting modes as well as a rich collection of filters and effects. The **Vignette effect** can be accessed from the **Edit Photo menu,** by tapping on the **Adjust button** and then opening the **Add menu** and selecting the effect from the list. The **Auto option** will be enabled by default and it will automatically adjust the vignette based on the composition of your photo. Alternatively, you can use the **strength, Softness or Radius** settings to control the size of the darkened area of the image or the vignette’s falloff. Even though the Photos app offers basic Vignetting tools that let you choose which part of a photo is going to be affected by the effect or how intense the effect is going to be, it is still better to use a more powerful photo editing app to create vignettes from your iPhone.

#### 2. [Final Touch](https://itunes.apple.com/app/final-touch-beautiful-high/id963756379?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $0.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-touch-vignette.jpg)

When creating a vignette, the lack of control over the feathering or opacity features can significantly limit your ability to produce vignettes that look natural. The Final Touch app is equipped with powerful vignetting tools that let you choose between **square, ellipse or circle shapes** of vignettes, move and rotate a vignette or adjust the feather size and fall off. However, the app doesn’t let you take photos, which means that all images you want to edit have to be imported from the camera roll. The Final Touch also offers a number of preset vignettes you can easily apply to a photo and customize in any way you want. After you’ve completed the vignetting process, you can share a photo to your social media accounts directly from the app.

#### 3. [Snapseed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

This photo editing app offers much more than the Vignette tool, as its users can process images in both **JPEG and RAW** file formats. Tap on the **Pencil icon** to access the app’s **Tool menu**, select the **Vignette option** and then proceed to adjust the **Outer and Inner Brightness** sliders. This will enable you to precisely define how dark you want the photo’s edges to be or how bright the central part of the picture is. To change the size of the vignette you just have to pinch in or out on the phone’s screen and **Center Size option** will appear near the bottom of the screen. Tap on the **Save button** once you’re happy with the results and then hit **Export** to create a copy of the photo that contains the changes you’ve made.

#### 4. [VSCO](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco/id588013838?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam&hl=en), iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsco-vignette-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful photo editor, the VSCO app is also a community of photography enthusiasts where you can discover inspiring work or connect with like-minded people. The app also features a collection of effects that enable you to recreate the look of vintage film produced by **Kodak, Fuji or Agfa.** Despite remarkably powerful photo editing options, VSCO is far from a perfect choice if you want to add a vignette to your photo since it only offers **basic vignetting tools**. You can add a vignette to a photo the same way you’d apply any other effect, but you won’t have access to advanced feathering options. iPhone and Android users in need of an app that lets them shoot and edit photos and videos should give VSCO a chance. Keep in mind that video editing options are only available if you purchase the VSCO X Membership.

#### 5. Afterlight 2

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/afterlight-2/id1293122457?mt=8)

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/afterlight-2-vignette-app.jpg)

iPhone photographers who would like to use photo editing tools such as **Curves, Selective Hue/Saturation or Clarify** are going to love using the Afterlife 2 app. Adding a vignette to a photo requires you to just tap on the **Adjustment Tools icon** and then **browse through the adjustment tools icons until you find the Vignette option**. Just tap on the Vignette icon to create the effect and then proceed to adjust the settings. Don’t expect too much control over the vignette size or feathering options, since Afterlight 2 only offers basic vignetting tools. Optionally, you can use Afterlight 2 as an **extension for the Apple Photos App** if you want to broaden the scope of photo editing tools you have at your disposal when using this native iPhone app.

#### 6. [PhotoToaster](https://itunes.apple.com/app/phototoaster-photo-editor-filters-effects-and-borders/id433671262?ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/phototoaster-photo-editor-vignette-app.jpg)

A brief look at the list of features PhotoToaster app provides will leave you wondering if there is anything this app can’t do. There are over eighty different one-click settings in **Lightning, Vignette, Texture or Border** categories that grant you total creative control over the photo editing process. You can add a vignette to a photo you imported into the app from your iPhone’s camera roll, but you can’t use PhotoToaster to take photos. Furthermore, you can use the lightning adjustments to balance the shadows and highlights or process colors on separate channels. The PhotoToaster app is a great asset to all photographers who take photos with their iPhones, not only because it lets them create vignettes in just a few taps, but because it enables them to edit their photos professionally.

#### 7. [PicsArt Photo Editor](https://picsart.com/apps/)

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.picsart.studio&hl=en), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/picsart-photo-editor-collage/id587366035?mt=8)

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picsart-vignette-app.jpg)

Besides editing photos, you can also use the PicsArt app to create collages from your Smartphone. The app is also equipped with a rich effects library that contains the Vignette effect you can easily customize and apply to a photo. **Tap on the Effects icon**, **select the Vignette effect from the Fx section and then tap on the Gear icon to customize the effect**. Adjust the **Radius and Fade** sliders before picking the color of the vignette. **Tap on the Checkmark icon to confirm the changes** you’ve made and save the photo. PicsArt is a vibrant community of photography enthusiasts where you can share your works with other users or connect with photographers you like.

#### 8. [EffectsStudio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/effects-studio/id780467456?mt=8)

**Price:** $0.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/effects-studio-app.jpg)

The user-friendly interface and the abundance of photo editing options, make the EffectsStudio one of the best iOS-based photo editing app you can use to add vignettes to your photos. You just have to import a photo from the camera roll and enter the app’s **Edit mode** to start processing a photo. You can adjust the Vignette effect’s settings, by simply dragging sliders, and all changes you make will be immediately displayed on the screen. Make sure to complete all basic photo editing actions before you add a vignette to a photo in order to avoid losing a part of a picture. The app offers nearly eighty standard filters, more than two hundred custom filters as well as fifty effects you can use to enhance your photos.

#### 9. [EyeEm](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eyeem-photography/id445638931?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baseapp.eyeem&hl=en), iOS

The best part is that you can combine the Vignette effect with other options such as **Contrast, Exposure or Sharpen** to create a visual style you want. Sharing photos on this platform can help you get useful advice from more experienced photographers who can suggest a creative way to use vignettes or any other photo effects.

#### 10. [ToolWiz Photos](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.btows.photo&hl=en%5FUS)

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** Android, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/toolwiz-photos/id1002417201?mt=8)

This simple photo editing app offers **AI filters**, and effects you can apply to a picture in just a single tap. All effects, including the Vignette effect located in the **Photography menu**, are fully customizable, so you can **adjust the radius or choose where the center of the vignette is going to be**. When done, you just have to tap on the **Checkmark icon** to confirm the changes you made and then proceed to apply an art filter like **Grainy Film or use Fish Eye, Double Exposure or Mirror effects**. The app’s file sharing capabilities could be better since you have to save all the photos you edit to your phone.

**Conclusion**

Making the edges of a photo darker can without a doubt make your photos stand out, but falling in love with vignettes and using this effect excessively is not necessarily a great idea. Using vignettes in your photos subtly so they aren’t easy to notice will probably create the best results. Which iPhone or Android vignette app do you use to edit your photos?

Sharing unedited photos and videos on your social media accounts can negatively reflect on the number of views and like your posts are getting. You don’t necessarily have to know a lot about photo or video editing process in order to add a vignette to a picture or adjust its color, brightness or highlights. As a matter of fact, all you need is a great app that lets you emphasize the center of the image and darken its edges. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best vignette apps for iPhones and Android devices that make the vignetting process fun.

## Top 10 Vignette Apps in 2024 \[Free & Paid\]

Vignettes can be used to make your selfies look more artistic or to increase the contrast between the edges and the center of a landscape photo. Even though you can use vignetting in any type of photo or video, it is still advisable to carefully choose the images to which you’d like to add this effect, since the results you’re going to get depend mostly on the quality of the original footage. Here are the ten best vignette apps in 2019.

#### 1. [Apple Photos App](https://support.apple.com/photos)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS

iPhone users can edit their photos with the built-in Photos app that offers a variety of photo and video shooting modes as well as a rich collection of filters and effects. The **Vignette effect** can be accessed from the **Edit Photo menu,** by tapping on the **Adjust button** and then opening the **Add menu** and selecting the effect from the list. The **Auto option** will be enabled by default and it will automatically adjust the vignette based on the composition of your photo. Alternatively, you can use the **strength, Softness or Radius** settings to control the size of the darkened area of the image or the vignette’s falloff. Even though the Photos app offers basic Vignetting tools that let you choose which part of a photo is going to be affected by the effect or how intense the effect is going to be, it is still better to use a more powerful photo editing app to create vignettes from your iPhone.

#### 2. [Final Touch](https://itunes.apple.com/app/final-touch-beautiful-high/id963756379?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $0.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-touch-vignette.jpg)

When creating a vignette, the lack of control over the feathering or opacity features can significantly limit your ability to produce vignettes that look natural. The Final Touch app is equipped with powerful vignetting tools that let you choose between **square, ellipse or circle shapes** of vignettes, move and rotate a vignette or adjust the feather size and fall off. However, the app doesn’t let you take photos, which means that all images you want to edit have to be imported from the camera roll. The Final Touch also offers a number of preset vignettes you can easily apply to a photo and customize in any way you want. After you’ve completed the vignetting process, you can share a photo to your social media accounts directly from the app.

#### 3. [Snapseed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

This photo editing app offers much more than the Vignette tool, as its users can process images in both **JPEG and RAW** file formats. Tap on the **Pencil icon** to access the app’s **Tool menu**, select the **Vignette option** and then proceed to adjust the **Outer and Inner Brightness** sliders. This will enable you to precisely define how dark you want the photo’s edges to be or how bright the central part of the picture is. To change the size of the vignette you just have to pinch in or out on the phone’s screen and **Center Size option** will appear near the bottom of the screen. Tap on the **Save button** once you’re happy with the results and then hit **Export** to create a copy of the photo that contains the changes you’ve made.

#### 4. [VSCO](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco/id588013838?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam&hl=en), iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsco-vignette-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful photo editor, the VSCO app is also a community of photography enthusiasts where you can discover inspiring work or connect with like-minded people. The app also features a collection of effects that enable you to recreate the look of vintage film produced by **Kodak, Fuji or Agfa.** Despite remarkably powerful photo editing options, VSCO is far from a perfect choice if you want to add a vignette to your photo since it only offers **basic vignetting tools**. You can add a vignette to a photo the same way you’d apply any other effect, but you won’t have access to advanced feathering options. iPhone and Android users in need of an app that lets them shoot and edit photos and videos should give VSCO a chance. Keep in mind that video editing options are only available if you purchase the VSCO X Membership.

#### 5. Afterlight 2

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/afterlight-2/id1293122457?mt=8)

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/afterlight-2-vignette-app.jpg)

iPhone photographers who would like to use photo editing tools such as **Curves, Selective Hue/Saturation or Clarify** are going to love using the Afterlife 2 app. Adding a vignette to a photo requires you to just tap on the **Adjustment Tools icon** and then **browse through the adjustment tools icons until you find the Vignette option**. Just tap on the Vignette icon to create the effect and then proceed to adjust the settings. Don’t expect too much control over the vignette size or feathering options, since Afterlight 2 only offers basic vignetting tools. Optionally, you can use Afterlight 2 as an **extension for the Apple Photos App** if you want to broaden the scope of photo editing tools you have at your disposal when using this native iPhone app.

#### 6. [PhotoToaster](https://itunes.apple.com/app/phototoaster-photo-editor-filters-effects-and-borders/id433671262?ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/phototoaster-photo-editor-vignette-app.jpg)

A brief look at the list of features PhotoToaster app provides will leave you wondering if there is anything this app can’t do. There are over eighty different one-click settings in **Lightning, Vignette, Texture or Border** categories that grant you total creative control over the photo editing process. You can add a vignette to a photo you imported into the app from your iPhone’s camera roll, but you can’t use PhotoToaster to take photos. Furthermore, you can use the lightning adjustments to balance the shadows and highlights or process colors on separate channels. The PhotoToaster app is a great asset to all photographers who take photos with their iPhones, not only because it lets them create vignettes in just a few taps, but because it enables them to edit their photos professionally.

## Part 1 **What is aspect ratio?**

Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen's width will be almost twice as high as its height.

However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don't miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.

Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the**16\*9 aspect ratio calculator.**

Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.

Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.

Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.

## Part 2 **What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?**

The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9\. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.

You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.

The**16 \* 9 aspect ratio**calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.

## Part 3 **Top 16:9 resolutions**

These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.

**●** 15360×8640 (16K UHD)

**●** 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)

**●** 5120 × 2880 (5K)

**●** 3840 × 2160 (4K UHD)

**●** 3200 × 1800 (QHD+)

**●** 2560 × 1440 (QHD)

**●** 1920 × 1080 (Full HD)

**●** 1600 × 900 (HD+)

**●** 1366 × 768 (WXGA)

**●** 1280 × 720 (HD)

**●** 960 × 540 (qHD)

**●** 854 × 480 (FWVGA)

**●** 640 × 360 (nHD)

## Part 4 **How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?**

First, let's look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9\. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9\. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.

Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3\. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The**16\*9 ratio calculator**is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920/1080 equals 16:9.

First, here's the formula that we will use in this section.

Width (W) /Height (H) = 1.778

Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.

1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.

Example 1:

Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.

W/H = 16/9

32/H = 16/9

H =32 × 9/16

H = 18

Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.

Example 2

Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9\. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.

W/H = 19/6

W/720 = 19/6

W = 730 × 19/6

Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.

## Part 5 **How to use an aspect ratio calculator?**

These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 \*9 ratio calculator will give the **remaining distance.**

Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.

The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:

**Step 1:** Go to <https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/>

**Step 2:** Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.

## Part 1 **What is aspect ratio?**

Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen's width will be almost twice as high as its height.

However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don't miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.

Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the**16\*9 aspect ratio calculator.**

Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.

Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.

Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.

## Part 2 **What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?**

The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9\. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.

You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.

The**16 \* 9 aspect ratio**calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.

## Part 3 **Top 16:9 resolutions**

These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.

**●** 15360×8640 (16K UHD)

**●** 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)

**●** 5120 × 2880 (5K)

**●** 3840 × 2160 (4K UHD)

**●** 3200 × 1800 (QHD+)

**●** 2560 × 1440 (QHD)

**●** 1920 × 1080 (Full HD)

**●** 1600 × 900 (HD+)

**●** 1366 × 768 (WXGA)

**●** 1280 × 720 (HD)

**●** 960 × 540 (qHD)

**●** 854 × 480 (FWVGA)

**●** 640 × 360 (nHD)

## Part 4 **How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?**

First, let's look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9\. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9\. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.

Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3\. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The**16\*9 ratio calculator**is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920/1080 equals 16:9.

First, here's the formula that we will use in this section.

Width (W) /Height (H) = 1.778

Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.

1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.

Example 1:

Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.

W/H = 16/9

32/H = 16/9

H =32 × 9/16

H = 18

Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.

Example 2

Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9\. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.

W/H = 19/6

W/720 = 19/6

W = 730 × 19/6

Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.

## Part 5 **How to use an aspect ratio calculator?**

These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 \*9 ratio calculator will give the **remaining distance.**

Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.

The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:

**Step 1:** Go to <https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/>

**Step 2:** Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.
