# Similar Software or Alternatives to VirtualDub

##### Ollie Mattison

For those who have previously used VirtualDub for editing or recording their videos files, are you looking for an alternative that runs on different platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux)? In this article, we introduce top 10 VirtualDub alternatives. Read on and find the best one that fits your needs.

## Best Alternatives to VirtualDub

#### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 Wondershare Filmora is an ideal VirtualDub alternative. It virtually supports much more formats than VirtualDub and includes almost all the common video editing functions VirtualDub provides. Although it doesn't support plug-ins, you can easily easily retouch your video with effects like jump cut, tilt-shift and much more and share your works with the world.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### Main features of Wondershare Filmora Video Editor

* Intuitive interface

 It provides a nice organized work space that allows for video, text and audio layering. The drag-n-drop feature enables you to easily access everything. The preview window is also included in the main interface so that you're able to see the real-time effect immediately.

* Powerful editing functions

 You can adjust your video using Contrast, Brightness and Saturation options with just one-click. An array of video effects like video filters, transitions, intro/credits, tilt shift, mosaic, face off, jump cut and more are also provided to enhance your video instantly.

* Various output selections

 When the editing process is over, you can easily save or share the creation. Different output methods include encoding the video into a specific file format that's compatible with mobile devices; direct uploading onto YouTube or Facebook or burning a DVD

#### 2\. [Video Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/)

 Video Converter supports the processing and conversion of almost all of the popular file types that's currently used. It has less editing options provided by VirtualDub, but the built-in video editor also provides several basic video editing functions such as crop, trim, rotate, add filters and more. On top of that, you can download videos directly from the online sites or create and burn your own videos onto a DVD. The preset of best video settings for playback on a variety of portable devices makes it even more convenient.

#### 3\. [Virtual VCR](http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualvcr/?source=directory)

![virtualvcr](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/virtualvcr.gif "virtualvcr")

 Virtual VCR is a DirectShow video capture application for Windows. It works together with video capture cards to capture audio and video to your hard drive in the AVI file format. It also digitizes audio/video content from sources like webcams, camcorders, and VCRs (Video Cassette Recorder). However, the editing functions are less powerful compared to VirtualDub.

#### 4\. [Free Video Dub](http://www.dvdvideosoft.com/products/dvd/Free-Video-Dub.htm)

![free video dub](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/videodub.jpg "free video dub")

 Free Video Dub is lightweight and user-friendly video editing tool for Windows which just like VirtualDub. It supports various video formats including AVI, MOV, FLV, MOD, MKV, MTS/M2TS and more. The main function is to delete the unwanted parts from video files without re-coding, which means it keeps the original quality of your video, so it may lack of some video editing functions you're looking for.

#### 5[Avidemux](http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/)

![avidemux](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/avidemux.jpg "avidemux")

 Avidemux is very close to VirtualDub on the basis of functions. It even runs on more platforms including Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
