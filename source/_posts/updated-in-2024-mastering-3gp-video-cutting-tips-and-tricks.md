3GP(3GPP file format) is a multimedia container format used by mobile phones. It is a simplified version of the MP4 format and was designed to make file sizes smaller so mobile phones could support video. In this article, we will introduce a very easy-to-use tool: Wondershare 3GP cutter and splitter, which can be used to split large 3GP video clips into smaller files, or to extract key messages from any videos with a .3gp extension. Follow the steps we are about to outline and you will have no issues with your 3GP video cutting experience.

To get started, download and install this smart 3GP cutter -[Wondershare Filmora (for Win and Mac)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). And then follow the step-by-step tutorial below to chop your 3GP files.

### How to cut 3gp file with Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)

#### 1\.  Add 3GP files to Wondershare 3GP cutting tool

There are two different ways for you to add 3GP files to this 3GP splitter. Hit the “Import” button on the main menu of the interface to browse your computer and then import your wanted 3GP files to this app’s album. Or you can also add your files by directly dragging and dropping them into this app’s album.

![3GP splitter](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-video-1.jpg)

#### 2 Cut 3GP video clips

Drag one of the source 3GP files from the album to the timeline at the bottom. And then move the top of the red Time Indicator to put it at one point you want, click the scissor-like icon, move the Time Indicator to another point, and hit the scissor icon again. In this way, you can split the 3GP file into several clips.

If you want to chop a big 3GP file into several small-size files, at this time, you need to save the whole project for backup purpose. Then, import the saved project again and again to delete redundant clips to just export the only one into a single file each time.

But if you want to cut out some unwanted segments or to extract some parts you want, just hit the clips you don’t want and click the “Delete” icon.

#### 3 Export the rest 3GP clips

When everything is done, just press the “Create” button to export the new file. At this time, a pop-up window will pop up to let you select an output method. If you still want to keep the file in 3GP format, just go to Format category and choose 3GP as the output format. After that, you can find the output file according to the output path.
Wondershare 3GP Cutter and splitter also lets you to directly upload to any of those popular video sharing sites such as Youtube, Facebook, Vimeo etc. or to export to any popular mobile devices.

Video formats supported are less than Free Video Cutter. Be sure to check if your original file is supported if you are cutting video clips other than 3GP.
