The screen size of the media players, devices, and platforms differ, and thus while uploading or playing videos the aspect ratio of the videos has to be adjusted accordingly.

Learn about **aspect ratio changer video** tools in the following parts of the topic.

02 [Need for Changing the Aspect Ratio](#Part 2)

03 [Top 10 Free Aspect Ratio Changing Tools](#Part 3)

04 [The Best Alternative to Free Tools for Changing Aspect Ratio- Wondershare Filmora](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What is Aspect Ratio and its importance?

In simplest terms, the Aspect ratio defines the relationship between the width and the height of a graphic. The values mentioned in the aspect ratio are not the actual value but refer to the relation of the width and height. Aspect ratio is expressed in terms of X: Y where X refers to the width while Y refers to the height of the video. Several aspect ratio standards are used in the present times like 16:9, 4:3, 3:2, 1.85:1, and more.

An aspect ratio defines the resolution of the display and thus for proper video playback that fits in within the screen size, the right aspect ratio has to be selected. Aspect ratio plays an important role in video resizing. To ensure that the videos do not look distorted while resizing, its aspect ratio has to be maintained.

## Part 2 Need for changing the aspect ratio

Videos recorded on different devices have different aspect ratios and thus to make them compatible with other players and platforms, the need for change in the aspect ratio arises. Moreover, platforms like YouTube, IGTV, Twitter, Facebook, and others have their recommendations for aspect ratio and to play your videos on these platforms, you need to match these requirements.
