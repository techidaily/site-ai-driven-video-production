### 10. Video Looper Chrome Extension

A free tool that works with the Google Chrome web browser, Video Looper is a Chrome Extension that can be added and enabled in order to loop the videos that you play on YouTube. Post adding, the extension automatically gets enabled as soon as it detects an eligible YouTube video on Chrome. Once enabled, you can even detach the panel to use it independently.

#### How to use the Chrome extension to loop video?

1. Launch Google Chrome and go to <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-looper/cakhljgchfghghfapljifddkaomfijcn>
2. Click **Add to Chrome**, and then click **Add Extension** when the confirmation box pops up
3. Close and then reopen Google Chrome
4. Go to the YouTube’s clip URL that you want to **video loop**
5. Click the **Video Looper** icon from the top-right corner of the browser
6. Click **Create Repeat**
7. Enter a value (the number of times you want to loop the video) in the **Repeat Times** field
8. Optionally enter the relevant values in the **Start Time** and **End Time** fields to trim the footage
9. Click **Create**
10. Click **Start & Play** on the next box that appears to play the YouTube video for the number of times you specified

**Pros**

* Free to use
* Can create an unlimited number of presets to play the videos in loops

**Cons**

* Doesn’t allow you to download the videos

**Summary**

Depending on your budget, frequency of **video loop** requirements, and the level of details you need while preparing a full-fledged video with repetitions, you can choose any of the tools explained above. However, if you need a comparatively better solution, Wondershare UniConverter would be your best bet as it is not merely a **free video looper**, it also offers several other features to get a complete output with quite granular edits.
