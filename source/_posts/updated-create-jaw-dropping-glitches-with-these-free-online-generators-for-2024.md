The Glitch Art movement is gaining a lot of attention on social media, as the photos and videos that contain glitches gather thousands of views and likes. Some video editing software products don’t have preset glitch effects, and creating this effect from scratch can be a time-consuming task.

Online glitch effect generators enable you to add glitch effects to both photos and videos even if you have no previous video editing experience, which makes them a great option for all social media content creators who want to go through the editing process as quickly as possible. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best free online glitch effect generators you can use to edit photos and videos.

![Glitchatron ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/errozero-glitch-effect-generator.jpg)

Glitchatron also lets you apply a circular or triangular mask to the photo or add a text overlay.

**Cons**

* Text can be either black or white
* No photo editing tools

### 5. [ImageGlitcher](https://www.airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/imageglitcher/)

You shouldn’t expect great results from this online glitch generator, as the website is poorly designed and it offers only a few basic glitch adjustment options. The size of the photo you upload to the website has an impact on how it is going to be displayed, which means that photos in large resolutions may be difficult to preview.

![ImageGlitcher ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airtightinteractive-image-glitcher.jpg)

Furthermore, you can only adjust Glitchiness and Brightness options, while you can also toggle the Scan Line option on and off. You can’t do much else with ImageGlitcher, not even share your creations on social media. Applying the glitch effect to a photo may take a while, and the website might crash in the process. That’s why you shouldn’t use ImageGlitcher unless it is your only option to glitch a photo.

**Pros**

* It is free
* Support images saved in JPEG format

**Cons**

* Website crashes easily
* Only basic glitch effect settings
* Poorly designed and difficult to navigate
* Only works with photos that have resolution lower than 1024x1024
