### Step 3.Connect WiFi

Make sure that your computer and TV are connected in the same network. You should be connected to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi network.  
If your Chromecast can't be connected to the Wi-Fi network, please [check the Chromecast router compatibility here](https://support.google.com/chromecast/table/3477832?hl=en&ref%5Ftopic=3205565).

### Step 4.Install Google cast extension

[Please download Google cast extension here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd?hl). After installation, there will be a Cast tab on the Chrome browser. You can click the option button to set video quality as Extreme (720p high bitrate) or High (720p) for your HD TV.

### Step 5\. Play local Video or music

Drag your local files to chrome browser, or press Ctr + O to browse and import your files. And then your video will be played in Chrome's built-in video viewer. Then click the Cast current tab on your browser to stream media files to Chromecast and then play it on TV.

Also you can choose Cast entire screen to share your desktop screen instead of a Chrome tab to TV.

**Note:**

1\. If your videos can't be streamed, that's because Chromecast doesn't support these formats. [You can check all the supported media here](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media). If you really want to cast any format, check the second solution.

2\. Stream video in background: When you stream video to your TV, you can use the 2 Windows short cuts to stream local video to Chromecast in background.  
Alt+Tab: It lets you do other things by switching to other opened programs/apps  
Ctrl+Esc: You can start a new program by pressing the 2 buttons to pop up the Star menu.
