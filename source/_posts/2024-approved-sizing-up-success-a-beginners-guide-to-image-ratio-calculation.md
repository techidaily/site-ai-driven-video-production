## Sizing Up Success: A Beginner's Guide to Image Ratio Calculation

You might have noticed that earlier DVDs came with full screen or widescreen viewing choices. Moreover, when you choose the wrong option, it cuts off the movie parts, or the video gets surrounded by black padding.

The standard resolution of your screen stretched from a 4:3 aspect ratio to the wider one. So, producers started making movies that fit on both screens. After the standardization of aspect ratio display, broadcasters pay attention to the image ratio of clips.

So, below is the guide to find, calculate and adjust image ratio with a picture ratio calculator. Let's get started.

01 [What is the image ratio?](#Part 1)

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.

If you want to make permanent adjustments, use a convertor or editor. "Wondershare Filmora" is the best video editor that allows you to create videos with different aspect ratios and adjust these ratios easily.

### 1\. [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)

We are confident that you will not find a more user-friendly video editor than this one. OpenShot is most likely the best choice when you're new to video production. It is simple to use, but it also has several interesting features.

### 9\. [Cinelerra](http://cinelerra.org/)

Cinelerra is a video editor for GNU/Ubuntu, first released in 1998\. It was the first non-linear video editor for GNU/Ubuntu that was functional with 64-bit platforms. Cinelerra was a huge hit in its early years since it was a comprehensive and free video editor that was practically unique in its field. However, as time went on, progress slowed, and many users abandoned the project.

Currently, work is ongoing, and new Ubuntu versions are being released in stages. Cinelerra includes a split editing panel that, like Gimp, allows for non-linear video editing. Like all other video editors, Cinelerra provides a variety of video effects and transitions for producing movies and slideshows. We can get Cinelerra from Sourceforge; once we install it, we should run the program using the./ command.

### 10\. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

Like Lightworks and KDenlive, this video editor is geared towards advanced users, but the greatest part is that it is free. It focuses on 3D animation rather than traditional video editing. It's widely used in 3D modeling, visual effects, animation, simulation, pipeline, and game development.

Blender has filters, transitions, [keyframes](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), adjustment layers, speed control, live preview, histogram displays, luma waveform, and chroma vectorscope for video production. Aside from that, it also allows you to mix, sync, and scrub audio files.

Because all of these functions might be a steep learning curve, it is a little challenging for inexperienced video producers. It is, without a doubt, the finest example of a free and open-source community project. Blender is a free program found in practically any software app store.

**Conclusion**

Well, there you have it – your best **Ubuntu Video Editor** tools list. Using Ubuntu does not preclude you from installing high-quality apps. Except for the [video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) described above, there are many other Ubuntu applications available.

A few are geared for pros (such as Lightworks, HitFilm Express, and Blender), while others are designed for beginners (similar to Shotcut and OpenShot). Additionally, because most video editors are currently accessible on the google play store, you would be able to download and install them on your Ubuntu laptop.

## Top 10 Best Free Video Editors for Ubuntu

Picking the right video editor might be difficult for some people, but that's where FOSS Ubuntu comes in. We've gathered a list of the finest **video editors for Ubuntu** for your benefit. We have tried and tested these apps. And based on our experience, we recomend:

| [1 - OpenShot](#1)  | [2 - OBS Studio](#2) | [3 - PiTiVi](#3)          | [4 - Kdenlive](#4) |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| [5 - Shotcut](#5)   | [6 - Lightworks](#6) | [7 - HitFilm Express](#7) | [8 - VLC](#8)      |
| [9 - Cinelerra](#9) | [10 - Blender](#10)  | [](#)                    | [ ](#)             |

### 1\. [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)

We are confident that you will not find a more user-friendly video editor than this one. OpenShot is most likely the best choice when you're new to video production. It is simple to use, but it also has several interesting features.

This editor comes with a plethora of titles and transitions and compatibility for the majority of video and picture formats. You also receive an excellent export option that allows you to save files in various formats. As already mentioned, the application is designed to meet the needs of beginning learners; yet, advanced users will not be dissatisfied because it supports high-quality video formats such as 4K.

OpenShot has several useful audio editing capabilities, including seeing waveforms on the timeline and even displaying the waveform as part of the film. It also allows you to [separate the sound from the video clip](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and tune each sound channel separately.

### 2\. [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)

OBS Studio is a free, open-source tool that can be downloaded and installed on Ubuntu and other operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Because it includes a fantastic [screen capturer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), OBS Studio is becoming famous for making videos of Ubuntu or other computer programs. OBS Studio is a basic video editor that lets us blend photos, movies, and music easily.

OBS Studio can create movies in the following formats: Flv, Mkv, mp4, mov, ts, and m3u8\. Although the formats are not very open, they are compatible with internet video publishing sites. This editor allows us to modify video rather than merely broadcast it, albeit the editing functionality is not as robust as Kdenlive or Openshot.

OBS Studio also links with video streaming sites to create live videos, unlike other video editing software. This has made it a highly popular software among YouTubers and one that we can download on any Ubuntu version.

### 3\. [PiTiVi](https://www.pitivi.org/)

Like many others, this one lets you perform basic video editing activities such as trimming, cutting, snapping, splitting, and mixing. The program also supports several additional languages for those who aren't fluent in English. You should probably read the manual before using it since it contains a lot of valuable information on using this application.

In a word, the application provides a touch-capable, hardware-accelerated user experience. Limitless video/audio track layers, full undo/redo history, trimming, cutting, sound editing of several concurrent audio layers upon layer, volume keyframe curves, keyframe audio enhancements, and more are all supported.

Pitivi creates thumbnails and waveforms in the background to provide you with the best performance without interfering with your workflow. Pitivi may be found in most Ubuntu software repositories. If you want, you may also download pre-assembled kits.

Kdenlive is, without a doubt, one of the best video editing applications for Ubuntu available right now! What sets it apart from other video editors is that it is completely free and includes several useful features. The MLT Framework, which is based on many other open-source projects, handles most of the video editing in Kdenlive, built on Qt and the KDE Frameworks libraries.

Adjustable layout compatibility, a clip list, a multitrack chronology, automatic backup, keyframe special effects, and transitioning are all included in this video editing program. Do you have a special file format or camcorder? Not an issue — Kdenlive works with practically anything.

It's also worth noting that Kdenlive runs on Mac OSX and FreeBSD. Proxy editing is another useful function. This handy function can produce low-quality duplicates of your source clips for quick editing and render them in full resolution.

### 5\. [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/)

Another free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor is Shotcut. Unlike Kdenlive, beginner video editors would obtain a comprehensive understanding of Shotcut because of its user-friendly interface. It has indigenous timeline editing, video transitions and filters, and a multitrack timeline, among other things.

Keyframes for digital filters and 3-point editing are supported. Shotcut is useful if you need to [remove the audio from a video clip](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) rapidly. Additionally, it allows you to edit audio and 4K films. Furthermore, it allows for external monitoring.

JACK transport sync, audio blending throughout all channels, stereo, mono, and 5.1 surround sound capabilities are supported on the audio front. Shotcut is considered ideal for beginners, and if you are one, we would highly suggest getting this one for your Ubuntu.

### 6\. [Lightworks](https://lwks.com/)

Because the functions go beyond the world of inexperienced editors, this video editor for Ubuntu computers is suited for specialists in video editing. The award-winning non-linear editing (NLE) program can handle 4K, Blu-Ray, and even SD and HD footage. You'll also discover Low-Res [Proxy workflows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for 4K and drag-and-drop support alongside those capabilities.

### 7\. [HitFilm Express](https://fxhome.com/product/hitfilm-express)

Check out HitFilm Express from FXhome when you seek the greatest video editing software but don't want to spend a lot of money. This [free video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) offers most of the same capabilities as top-tier production suites, featuring 4K video capability, 360-degree editing, and hundreds of special effects.

In reality, when it comes to editing capabilities, Hitfilm Express is extremely similar to Adobe Premiere Pro.

The major disadvantage of this program is that it consumes a lot of system resources, which means it won't run on many lightweight laptops.

Hitfilm Express is a video editor that is so strong and simple to use that it's difficult to believe it's free. It's a great option for any video creator on a shoestring budget.

## Top 10 Best Free Video Editors for Ubuntu

Picking the right video editor might be difficult for some people, but that's where FOSS Ubuntu comes in. We've gathered a list of the finest **video editors for Ubuntu** for your benefit. We have tried and tested these apps. And based on our experience, we recomend:

| [1 - OpenShot](#1)  | [2 - OBS Studio](#2) | [3 - PiTiVi](#3)          | [4 - Kdenlive](#4) |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |

| [9 - Cinelerra](#9) | [10 - Blender](#10)  | [](#)                    | [ ](#)             |

### 1\. [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)

We are confident that you will not find a more user-friendly video editor than this one. OpenShot is most likely the best choice when you're new to video production. It is simple to use, but it also has several interesting features.

This editor comes with a plethora of titles and transitions and compatibility for the majority of video and picture formats. You also receive an excellent export option that allows you to save files in various formats. As already mentioned, the application is designed to meet the needs of beginning learners; yet, advanced users will not be dissatisfied because it supports high-quality video formats such as 4K.

OpenShot has several useful audio editing capabilities, including seeing waveforms on the timeline and even displaying the waveform as part of the film. It also allows you to [separate the sound from the video clip](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and tune each sound channel separately.

### 2\. [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)

OBS Studio is a free, open-source tool that can be downloaded and installed on Ubuntu and other operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Because it includes a fantastic [screen capturer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), OBS Studio is becoming famous for making videos of Ubuntu or other computer programs. OBS Studio is a basic video editor that lets us blend photos, movies, and music easily.

OBS Studio can create movies in the following formats: Flv, Mkv, mp4, mov, ts, and m3u8\. Although the formats are not very open, they are compatible with internet video publishing sites. This editor allows us to modify video rather than merely broadcast it, albeit the editing functionality is not as robust as Kdenlive or Openshot.

OBS Studio also links with video streaming sites to create live videos, unlike other video editing software. This has made it a highly popular software among YouTubers and one that we can download on any Ubuntu version.

### 3\. [PiTiVi](https://www.pitivi.org/)

Like many others, this one lets you perform basic video editing activities such as trimming, cutting, snapping, splitting, and mixing. The program also supports several additional languages for those who aren't fluent in English. You should probably read the manual before using it since it contains a lot of valuable information on using this application.

In a word, the application provides a touch-capable, hardware-accelerated user experience. Limitless video/audio track layers, full undo/redo history, trimming, cutting, sound editing of several concurrent audio layers upon layer, volume keyframe curves, keyframe audio enhancements, and more are all supported.

Pitivi creates thumbnails and waveforms in the background to provide you with the best performance without interfering with your workflow. Pitivi may be found in most Ubuntu software repositories. If you want, you may also download pre-assembled kits.

### 4\. [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/)

Kdenlive is, without a doubt, one of the best video editing applications for Ubuntu available right now! What sets it apart from other video editors is that it is completely free and includes several useful features. The MLT Framework, which is based on many other open-source projects, handles most of the video editing in Kdenlive, built on Qt and the KDE Frameworks libraries.

Adjustable layout compatibility, a clip list, a multitrack chronology, automatic backup, keyframe special effects, and transitioning are all included in this video editing program. Do you have a special file format or camcorder? Not an issue — Kdenlive works with practically anything.

It's also worth noting that Kdenlive runs on Mac OSX and FreeBSD. Proxy editing is another useful function. This handy function can produce low-quality duplicates of your source clips for quick editing and render them in full resolution.

### 5\. [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/)

Another free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor is Shotcut. Unlike Kdenlive, beginner video editors would obtain a comprehensive understanding of Shotcut because of its user-friendly interface.

### 6\. [Lightworks](https://lwks.com/)

Because the functions go beyond the world of inexperienced editors, this video editor for Ubuntu computers is suited for specialists in video editing. The award-winning non-linear editing (NLE) program can handle 4K, Blu-Ray, and even SD and HD footage. You'll also discover Low-Res [Proxy workflows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for 4K and drag-and-drop support alongside those capabilities.

### 7\. [HitFilm Express](https://fxhome.com/product/hitfilm-express)

Check out HitFilm Express from FXhome when you seek the greatest video editing software but don't want to spend a lot of money. This [free video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) offers most of the same capabilities as top-tier production suites, featuring 4K video capability, 360-degree editing, and hundreds of special effects.

In reality, when it comes to editing capabilities, Hitfilm Express is extremely similar to Adobe Premiere Pro.

The major disadvantage of this program is that it consumes a lot of system resources, which means it won't run on many lightweight laptops. You'll have to pay extra for things like [360-degree](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) text, extra color grading facilities, and other aesthetic enhancements, among other things. Hitfilm Express is a video editor that is so strong and simple to use that it's difficult to believe it's free. It's a great option for any video creator on a shoestring budget.

### 9\. [Cinelerra](http://cinelerra.org/)

Cinelerra is a video editor for GNU/Ubuntu, first released in 1998\. It was the first non-linear video editor for GNU/Ubuntu that was functional with 64-bit platforms. Cinelerra was a huge hit in its early years since it was a comprehensive and free video editor that was practically unique in its field. However, as time went on, progress slowed, and many users abandoned the project.

Currently, work is ongoing, and new Ubuntu versions are being released in stages. Cinelerra includes a split editing panel that, like Gimp, allows for non-linear video editing. Like all other video editors, Cinelerra provides a variety of video effects and transitions for producing movies and slideshows. We can get Cinelerra from Sourceforge; once we install it, we should run the program using the./ command.

### 10\. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

Like Lightworks and KDenlive, this video editor is geared towards advanced users, but the greatest part is that it is free. It focuses on 3D animation rather than traditional video editing. It's widely used in 3D modeling, visual effects, animation, simulation, pipeline, and game development.

Blender has filters, transitions, [keyframes](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), adjustment layers, speed control, live preview, histogram displays, luma waveform, and chroma vectorscope for video production. Aside from that, it also allows you to mix, sync, and scrub audio files.

Because all of these functions might be a steep learning curve, it is a little challenging for inexperienced video producers. It is, without a doubt, the finest example of a free and open-source community project. Blender is a free program found in practically any software app store.

**Conclusion**

Well, there you have it – your best **Ubuntu Video Editor** tools list. Using Ubuntu does not preclude you from installing high-quality apps. Except for the [video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) described above, there are many other Ubuntu applications available.

Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.

Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.
