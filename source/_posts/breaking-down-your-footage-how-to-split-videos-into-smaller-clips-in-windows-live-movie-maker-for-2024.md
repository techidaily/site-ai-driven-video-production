## Part 2: How to Brighten a Video on Your iPhone Before or While Recording

A gloomy video isn't fun to watch, but it's frequently difficult to know in the present if the video you're capturing is too dull to see clearly.

Brightening an iPhone video can help you see the activity on-screen and make it more appealing if you share it on social media or post it to a website.

Because the iPhone's built-in camera app does not enable you to brighten films after they have been recorded, you should always try to light a video before you begin recording.

**Step 1:** Switch to video mode by opening the camera app and swiping left. Touch the screen to bring up a box with a sun-shaped symbol.

**Step 2**: Move your fingers upward on the iPhone screen to brighten the scene when you begin filming. This may be done at any moment while the video is being recorded.

**Conclusion**

There are a ton of **Video Brightening Editor Apps** that will make brightening the videos after filming quite easy for you. Long gone are the days when you had to re-film now and again until you would get that one final shot that has every color adjustment aspect fit to perfection. With the advent of amazing software such as those covered in this article, brightening a dark video has never been easier!
