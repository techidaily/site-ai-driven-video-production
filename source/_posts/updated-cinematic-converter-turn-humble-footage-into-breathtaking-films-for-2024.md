B612 is primarily a beauty and filter camera that is commonly used for taking stunning selfies, which also features a Face Swap option. You just have to click on the Smiley icon after launching the app and then select the face swap option from the menu. However, the feature only works in real-time, so you must have two people in your shot. Once you’ve enabled the face swap option, you should simply start recording a video or take a picture, and the app will automatically swap faces.

Making a meme or any other type of funny photo is easy with this app because you just have to cut a face from one picture and paste it onto another. Optionally, you can use the magnifying glass feature that allows you to cut a picture more precisely. All faces you cut from images will be saved in the app’s Face Gallery, and you can use them over and over again without having to go through the image cutting process. After choosing a face, you can quickly paste it onto a new photo and add a funny caption or a sticker to make the comic effect even more obvious.

To make things even better, you can swap multiple faces in a single photo, as the Face Swap app automatically finds faces in pictures and places a new face over them. However, the results you will be able to get won’t necessarily be perfect each and every time, so you have to arm yourself with patience and keep trying until you create an image you feel confident sharing on social media.
