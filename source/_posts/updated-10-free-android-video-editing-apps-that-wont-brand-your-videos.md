Filmora offers a special **big discount** to get the program at comparatively cheap rates if you subscribe for any of the available creative video solution bundles. What these bundles are, you may ask. The answer is, when you buy a subscription for another product along with Filmora, both the apps form a bundle and are offered to you at a discounted price.

For instance, you can buy a subscription for both Filmora and others products at the same time, and when you subscribe to these two apps, you are offered a special discount to purchase the bundle.

You can follow the instructions given below to buy a Wondershare creative video solution bundle:

### Step 1: Get to the Creative Video Solution Bundles Page

Open your favorite web browser, and go to the [Filmora Creative Bundle](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) link. Here you can notice the available packages to best suit all your production and post-production needs.

### Step 2: Choose a Bundle Category

Click to select a bundle category from the navigation bar on the left of the page. If you want to see all the bundles offered by Wondershare, you can leave the **All Bundles** category selected The details of all the bundles are given below. If you are not familiar with the bundled product, here are some brief introductions.

* **Filmora and PixCut** **: Image BG Remover and Video Editing Solution**

| Filmora Annual Plan + PixCut Annual Plan | Bundle Price | Saving |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| $101.97                                  | $60.78       | $41.19 |

Editing photo background with Adobe Photoshop can be a little intimidating for beginners, owing to the crowded layout with hidden features. But now there's a simpler and free Photoshop alternative in PixCut. You don't need prior experience to make background transparent for your social media use.

* **Filmora and DemoCreator: Capture, Record and Edit Videos Like a Pro**

| Filmora Annual Plan + DemoCreator Annual Plan | Bundle Price | Saving |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| $91.23                                        | $71.98       | $19.25 |

DemoCreator allows you to record footage of your screen and then add visual effects, audio, and more in a simple, yet comprehensive editor quickly so that you can efficiently create informative and/or engaging videos for others to watch.

* **Filmora and UniConverter: Edit and Convert Video as the Way You Like**

| Filmora Annual Plan + UniConverter Annual Plan | Bundle Price | Saving |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| $89.98                                         | $71.98       | $18.00 |

Wondershare UniConverter, formerly known as Video Converter Ultimate, is a multipurpose application for all your production and post-production needs. The tool is equipped with features like a video compressor, trimmer, subtitle editor, and much more to give you everything under one roof. The table given below shows how much would you save if you go for this bundle.

### Step 3: Choose Your Bundle and Platform, and Buy the Pack

From the main window, decide which bundle you wish to subscribe for, use the available button to pick your preferred platform, i.e., **Mac** or **Windows**, and click **BUY NOW**.

On the next page, populate the fields with your details and the required billing information, and click **Secure Checkout** from the bottom-right corner to proceed with the payment process to buy the bundle. Once all the financial formalities are complete, you can go ahead and instantaneously download the products to install them on your computer.

**Note:** Buying **Download Insurance Service** is absolutely optional. When you subscribe for this insurance, the products you paid for remain available for download for the next 24 months from the date of purchase.

**Conclusion**

You can easily get a **Filmora coupon code** as long as you are a student and can sign in to your Student Beans account for verification. Furthermore, if you are a professional and are looking forward to buying multiple products to make your post-production experience smooth and quick, picking any of the creative video solution bundles will help you not only in buying multiple products in a single go but it will also offer the apps at discounted rates.
