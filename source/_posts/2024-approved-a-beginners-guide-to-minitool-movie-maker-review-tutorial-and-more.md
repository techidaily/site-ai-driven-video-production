Focus on your performance and let the app do the rest for you. You can dance, sing or act goofy in your music videos and Triller will edit your videos automatically. If you want, you can also use the app's trim or cut tools to remove any part of the video clip you don't like. The only downside is that music videos you record with Triller can't last longer than 30 seconds.

The app's music collection includes some of the most popular songs at the moment, so you can even participate in different music challenges or create lip-sync videos with music from your favorite singers. Triller lets you draw over videos, apply different visual effects or add text overlays, but some of these features must be purchased, as the free version of the app offers only a limited amount of ways to edit music and video.

The app's video editor lets you apply effects, add frames and text overlays, while you can also import as many as sixty photos from your camera roll and turn them into an HD video.

Choose from Free, Cinematic or Pop music categories, among others and start creating your own music video. This iOS-based app lets you choose the video clip from a camera roll and edit it using its powerful tools. Video Maker with Music Editor also lets you record your own voice or use sounds and songs from your music library.

You can add as many music tracks to your videos as you want, which means that you can combine two or more songs in a single clip. The app also features the fade-in and fade-out effect, so you can make smooth transitions between two songs. Sharing your favorite videos to Instagram or Facebook directly from Video Maker with Music Editor app, is easy, while you can also save your videos to your camera roll. The free version of the app contains only the basic music and video editing options, and in order to gain access to all features, you must select one of the available subscription plans.

**Conclusion**

Choosing a video maker app is much easier if you know what type of videos you want to produce. If you want to make short music videos lip-syncing features or the size of the music library the app offers should play a large role in your decision, while video editing tools should be your first priority if in addition to music videos you also plan to make vlogs or fashion videos. What is your favorite app for editing music videos? Leave a comment and let us know.
