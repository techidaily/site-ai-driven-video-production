 We often tend to record our precious moments in video and tend to share them with others. There are many among us who like to give their videos an extra spark by editing them. For that, they use a number of video editing software that they get their hands on. To make your choice easier from thousands of software I am listing the top five in the business. My list includes Apple iMovie, Avidemux, Blender, HyperEngine AV Video Editing Software and last but not the least, Wondershare Filmora. Let us go over the specifications and shed light on the comparisons.

## Top 5 MTS Video Editing Software Recommended

#### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Due to the features that it has, it can easily be placed at the top when considering video editing software genre. The most talked about features of this software are:

#### 2\. [Apple iMovie](https://www.apple.com/mac/imovie/)

 It is free video editing software that comes with the Mac OS every time a new one is released. The latest Apple iMovie version is 11\. Although it is free, you will only avail the free version when a new Mac OS releases. For updating without moving to a new OS version of Mac, you have to buy it. It is good software to have for free for its features. Some of the key features are:

* It helps to create One Step Effect.
* Support for 2D and 3D videos
* Supports Audio Encoding.
* You can Create Movie Trailers using the software

#### 3\. [AvideMux](http://sourceforge.net/projects/avidemux/files/latest/download)

![avidemux](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/avidemux.jpg)

#### 4\. [Blender](http://www.blender.org/download/)

 From 2002, Blender has been at the top of popularity charts for video editing. This is the popular video editor for 3D videos and it is commonly used for Rigging, Modeling, Texturing videos, animating, the simulation of smoke and water etc. This software is more suited for 3D video making. The popularity this software has can only be rivaled by very few in the market. The interface of Blender is very unique. Someone with no experience with Video Editing tool can have a hard time mastering it though. The video editing software is high end software which has features like:

* Advanced Simulation Tools.
* Advanced Level Animation Tools to create perfect animated bodies.
* Accumulates multiple scenes into one file.
* It is like a library for people who want to share and borrow video content which has been created.
* It is compatible for most of the operating systems.
* Consumes much less disk space.

![blender](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/blender01.jpg)

#### 5\. [HyperEngine AV](http://sourceforge.net/projects/hyperengine/files/latest/download?source=navbar)

 This little software is also a great one for video editing. One can easily use this to create slideshows. This is an award winning software from Arboretum Systems. The software has full source code integrated. One can edit the videos from his/her collection. Capturing video using the software is very easy. Audio processing, trackless document and many other edits are also possible using this piece of software. The important features of the software are:

* Dozens of effects are there to apply on a clip.
* FireWire DV camera is used to capture the images.
* Real time transition effects can be applied which are also automated.
* Trackless audio clips can be created through audio editing.

![hyper engine av](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/hyper-engine-av.jpg)

 With the basic idea about the software and the features, we can do a small comparison to see which one gets the edge when we talk about video editors. Let us compare all five software in a table for differences and performances.

| Features      | Apple iMovie | AvideMux        | Blender         | HyperEngine     | Wondershare Filmora                                  |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed         | None         | None            | None            | None            | Excellent (30X faster)                               |
| Editing Type  | Video/Audio  | Video/Audio     | 3D Video/Audio  | Video/Audio     | Video/Audio/Photos                                   |
| Mode Type     | Single       | Single          | Single          | Single          | Two Modes. Easy Editor and Full Featured Editor Mode |
| Compatibility | Mac          | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows                                      |

 With the above comparison, it is safe to say that the top three video converters are Blender, HyperEngine AV and Wondershare. But Wondershare has a slight edge over the two in terms of space taken and mode variations. Due to its two modes, novice users as well as professionals can perform great editing of videos, photos and audios. It supports photo editing which is a great plus for the users. It works as a good downloader and converter too. That is definitely a plus for all who use this software. Again, the compatibility is a great factor working towards its favor.

 With the basic idea about the software and the features, we can do a small comparison to see which one gets the edge when we talk about video editors. Let us compare all five software in a table for differences and performances.

| Features      | Apple iMovie | AvideMux        | Blender         | HyperEngine     | Wondershare Filmora                                  |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed         | None         | None            | None            | None            | Excellent (30X faster)                               |
| Editing Type  | Video/Audio  | Video/Audio     | 3D Video/Audio  | Video/Audio     | Video/Audio/Photos                                   |
| Mode Type     | Single       | Single          | Single          | Single          | Two Modes. Easy Editor and Full Featured Editor Mode |
| Compatibility | Mac          | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows                                      |

 With the above comparison, it is safe to say that the top three video converters are Blender, HyperEngine AV and Wondershare. But Wondershare has a slight edge over the two in terms of space taken and mode variations. Due to its two modes, novice users as well as professionals can perform great editing of videos, photos and audios. It supports photo editing which is a great plus for the users. It works as a good downloader and converter too. That is definitely a plus for all who use this software. Again, the compatibility is a great factor working towards its favor.

02 [How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?](#Part 2)

03 [How Can I Change the Aspect Ratio of an Image Online?](#Part 3)

04 [How to Change the Aspect Ratio in Filmora/Filmora Pro?](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos

An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.

And, it is written as 'x:y' where 'x' is the width and 'y' is the height.

There isn't any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.

Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.

Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.

Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg)

**16:9**

A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called "1.71:1," the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.

This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.

Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.

It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.

One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.

**1:1**

The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.

It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.

Many cameras still have a square setting even though it's not the most commonly used aspect ratio.

**4:3**

The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10\. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It's because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.

This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.

**3:2**

The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.

Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.

**21:9**

The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.

It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.

You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.

**9:16**

A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.

For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16\. The same goes for other famous apps with "story" features, including Snapchat and Facebook.

This makes sense because the iPhone camera's video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.

## Part 2 How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-3.jpg)

Most cameras with video capabilities are available with various aspect ratio settings. This helps you decide which aspect ratio you'd like your video to have before recording it.

If you are looking to determine the aspect ratio of a video already shot, you can easily access additional information for the file.

The information button is a small "i" in a circle on Mac. Move on to right-click a file and select "**Properties**" on your PC.

It may give you the actual width and height of the video, but you can divide the two to find the aspect ratio.

However, you don't need to hassle as we'll enlist the best five **aspect ratio** **calculators online** below.

This makes sense because the iPhone camera's video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.

## Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos

An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.

And, it is written as 'x:y' where 'x' is the width and 'y' is the height.

There isn't any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.

Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.

Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.

Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg)

**16:9**

A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called "1.71:1," the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.

This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.

Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.

It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.

One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.

**1:1**

The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.

It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.

Many cameras still have a square setting even though it's not the most commonly used aspect ratio.

**4:3**

The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10\. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It's because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.

This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.

**3:2**

The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.

Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.

**21:9**

The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.

It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.

You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.

**9:16**

A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.

For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16\. The same goes for other famous apps with "story" features, including Snapchat and Facebook.

This makes sense because the iPhone camera's video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.

## Part 2 How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-3.jpg)

Most cameras with video capabilities are available with various aspect ratio settings. This helps you decide which aspect ratio you'd like your video to have before recording it.

If you are looking to determine the aspect ratio of a video already shot, you can easily access additional information for the file.

The information button is a small "i" in a circle on Mac. Move on to right-click a file and select "**Properties**" on your PC.

It may give you the actual width and height of the video, but you can divide the two to find the aspect ratio.

## Unlock Your Chromebook: How to Run Linux

# How to Install Linux on Chromebook

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Chromebooks are an excellent choice for educational institutions or businesses that require their employees to have constant access to the Internet. Even though these devices are a perfect tool that can accompany you on business trips and enable you to answer important emails or have access to crucial information stored on the cloud, performing more demanding tasks, like video editing, is still a challenge. However, it is far from impossible, although you may have to take a few extra steps before running a video editing software on your Chromebook.

Chrome OS is a Linux based environment and for that reason, Chromebook owners who would like to use professional editing software on their Chromebooks can install a Linux OS that will enable them to use programs such as Lightworks that are perfectly suited for high-end video editing. There are two different ways to install Linux on a Chromebook, you can either do it using Gallium OS or ChrUbuntu or in a Chroot environment using Crouton. Each of these methods is relatively easy and we will take you through the process step by step. Here's how you can install Linux on your Chromebook.

* [Part 1: Preparing before installing Linux OS on Chromebook](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using ChrUbuntu](#part3)
* [Part 4: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook](#part4)
* [Part 5: Recommended Linux Video Editing Software](#part5)

## Part 1: Preparing before installing Linux OS on Chromebook

The first step of the process of installing the Linux OS is the decision itself, and you need to have all the necessary information before you decide to install a Linux OS on your Chromebook.

* Make sure that the version of Chromebook you have is capable of supporting a Linux OS. Your device must be equipped with an ARM or Intel chip in order to be able to run the version of Linux OS you want to install. Although both chips will allow you to go through the process, running closed source software such the Steam is only possible with Intel chips.
* Regardless of which method of installing Linux OS you choose, you will have to switch to the Developer Mode, a special built-in function that allows you to install the unapproved operating system, among other things.
* Now that you are aware of the requirements and risks, you will have to backup all the files you have on your Chromebook because once you switch to the Developer Mode all the information stored locally will be erased. You can save the files on another computer or on the cloud depending on how much data you need to move and which one is more convenient for you.

## Part 2: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook

After you have stored all your data safely, your Chromebook is ready for the beginning of the installation process of the secondary operating system. You will have to perform a series of actions that will allow you to start the installation, starting from accessing the Developer Mode.

#### 1. Acessing the developer mode

The first step of the process is to reboot your system, while your Chromebook is on. In order to do so hold Escape and Refresh keys on your keyboard and then hit the power button. Once your device is back online you will find yourself in the recovery mode, and you will see a message telling you to insert a recovery disc. Instead of inserting the disc, hold Ctrl+D and wait for OS verification menu to appear on the screen. At this point, if you are still having second thoughts about this process, you can hit the spacebar to return to recovery mode, or press Enter to proceed. Hitting Enter will delete all the data stored on your device and take you into the Developer Mode. Once your Chromebook lets you know that you are now in the Developer Mode, reboot the system and install a fresh version of the Chrome OS. Insert your login information and follow the instructions until you are looking at the Chrome OS desktop.

![Install Linux on Chromebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-1.jpg)

#### 2. Installing Chroot

At this stage of the process, your Chromebook is ready for the installation of the Crouton environment. Crouton is a series of scripts that makes running a Linux OS much easier, especially for inexperienced users. In order to download Crouton, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) and find the download link, detailed instructions or extensions that can add more functionality to your OS. Once the installation file or files are in the Download folder, your next step is to access the Chromebook's terminal a feature called 'Crosh'. The fastest way to do this is to hold CTRL + ALT keys and then hit the T key. This action will cause the Chrome window to appear on the screen, and you will need to type the 'shell' command without using quotation marks. Afterwards, enter the following command: 'sudo sh \~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce' and if you want to install extensions you will have to add 'xfce,extension' command at the end.

![Install Linux on Chromebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-2.jpg)

Press the Enter key and wait for the system to start setting up the Chroot. This process may take a while, so it is important to be patient, but more importantly, do not interfere with it in any way. Installation of your secondary OS is now on the way, and you may be asked to insert your login data, like your Gmail username and password. Wait patiently until the process is over and then return to shell and enter this command: 'sudo enter-chroot startxfce4'. Your screen will go black for a while, but after the black screen is gone your Chromebook will be in the freshly installed Linux OS.

#### 3. Optimizing your new OS

You may have to optimize your new OS in order to improve the experience of using it. Enabling your keyboard's brightness and volume keys inside the new OS can be done easily by holding CTRL+ALT+T and then typing shell once you've accessed Chrome OS's shell and hit Enter. Issue the following command: 'sudo sh -e \~/Downloads/crouton-r precise-t keyboard–u' and then press Enter again. Removing the screen saver or installing more extensions may also be a good way to enable more options in the new OS. Most importantly, you can now download and install the video editing software you want to use for editing your footage.

#### 4. Remove Chroot from your Chromebook

If for some reason you want to uninstall Linux from your Chromebook, simply reboot the system and press the spacebar when the 'OS verification is off' message appears on the screen. In this manner, you will exit the Developer Mode and all locally stored data, including all installed environments, will be deleted.

## Part 3: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using ChrUbuntu

An alternative option is available for Chromebook users that have Intel based devices like recently released Haswell models. The ChrUbuntu can be installed on the USB stick or external hard-drive or directly to the local memory of your Chromebook. Even though ARM-based machines can also use ChrUbuntu it isn't advisable because they may perform poorly due to slower processor speeds and less RAM power. Unlike Chroot, ChrUbuntu will not allow you to switch between operating systems without a reboot, and if the system is stored locally, you may need to go through the full system recovery.

#### 1. Preparation for the installation

Like with the previous method you will have to go into the Developer Mode and make sure that you have access to a WiFi connection. When you are asked to provide your login details, instead of entering them press Ctrl+Alt+Forward and then type 'chronos' and press Enter. The next step will require you to issue the following command: 'curl -L -O <http://goo.gl/9sgchs>; sudo bash 9sgchs' and then once more hit Enter. Again press Enter after the information about the installation is displayed on the screen and then you will be asked to decide how much space you want to allocate for Linux installation. Experts say that 9GB is the upper limit. After you've made your choice press Enter.

#### 2. Installing ChrUbuntu

Once the partitioning of your hard-drive is completed, you will have to repeat the first several steps from typing 'chronos' to pressing enter when information about the installation is displayed on the screen. The installation process is now in progress and you will be occasionally asked to select a few settings, make sure you always click on default. At the end of the installation process, you will have to choose the location where GRUB should be installed, please select /dev/sda, because the failure to do so may interrupt the installation.

Once the installation is completed, restart your Chromebook to finalize the process, and when you see the 'OS Verification is Off' notification press Ctrl+L to access Linux or Ctrl+D boot into Chrome OS.

![Install Linux on Chromebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-3.jpg)

#### 3. Uninstall ChrUbuntu

Removing ChrUbuntu is a relatively painless process that can be completed with just a few simple commands. If the OS is stored locally the only way to erase it is to perform a full system recovery. While all your data located on the cloud will re-sync with your Chromebook, the data stored locally will be deleted, which is why it is important to backup all the important files before starting a system recovery process. The fastest and easiest way to perform a system recovery is by creating a recovery disk from your device. Insert 'chrome://imageburner' in your browser's address bar, and carefully read and follow the instructions.

This Linux removal method will also require you to have a USB stick with a minimum of 4GB of storage space. After you created the disk, you can go into the Recovery Mode, by holding Esc and Refresh buttons simultaneously and then pressing the Power button. In the Recovery Mode, you will be asked to insert the recovery disk and the process will be on the way.

## Part 4: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using Gallium OS

If neither Chroot nor ChrUbuntu work for you, using Gallium OS may be the right choice. The Gallium is Xbuntu-based OS that is equipped with touchpad mouse drivers among other advantages it offers over other operating systems. The installation process isn't complicated, although it may require more effort than installing Crouton.

#### 1. Preparation for the installation

In order to be aware of all the preparation steps, you need to take, you must first find out your device's Hardware ID number and you can obtain this information by navigating to Chrome://System, Hardware Class within the Chrome OS. [Hardware Compatibility](https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware%5FCompatibility) page will provide the information regarding the CPU's family, which can be crucial for the OS' performance. You can run the installation either from an ISO image on an external USB drive or from the Chrome OS command line using Chrx. We will describe how to install Gallium OS from the Chrome OS command line because the other option doesn't allow you to dual-boot your Chromebook.

#### 2. Enabling the Legacy Mode

Like previously described, enter the Developer Mode and when the ' OS verification is OFF' notification appears on the screen proceed to enable the Legacy Mode. You can do this by holding CTRL+D keys to enable the Chrome OS to boot in the Developer Mode. After you've successfully made this step, press CTRl+ALT+T to access the 'Crosh' terminal and then type 'shell'. At the 'chronos/localhost/$ issue the following command: 'sudo crossystem dev\_boot\_legacy=1'. Update and install all the necessary firmware by running the Firmware Utility Script.

#### 3. Installation process

If you choose to install Gallium OS through Chrome OS command line using Chrx that will enable you to dual-boot your Chromebook, you should start by booting the device into Chrome OS and configuring networking. The next step you'll need to take is switching to a virtual terminal by holding Ctrl+Alt+F2, and then you should log in as user chronos without a password. Once you've completed this step issue the following command: 'curl -O <https://chrx.org/go> && sh go' and follow the on-screen instructions to repartition your hard-drive and install the Gallium OS. Once the installation is over reboot the device and press Ctrl+L when the 'OS Verification is Off' notification appears on the screen to boot Gallium OS or hold Ctrl+D to access Chrome OS. After the Gallium OS is successfully installed on your Chromebook you can start using programs such as Skype or Lightworks.

#### Which Method is the Best?

Each of the options to install a Linux OS on your Chromebook we described has its advantages and disadvantages. It is our opinion that the Crouton method is the easiest and the fastest. Furthermore, this method enables you to switch between your primary and secondary OS without the need to reboot the device and the Downloads folder makes working in both environments much easier.

On the other hand, other methods require more knowledge about the Linux OS installation process and switching between OS' is not that simple. If you are looking for an easy way to dual-boot your Chromebook that best way to do it is to install Linux as a Chroot using Crouton.

## Part 5: Recommended Linux Video Editing Software: Lightworks

**Price:** $24.99/month, although free versions of the software are also available.

**What we like:** A powerful video and audio editor perfectly suited for the production of professional video content.

**What we don't like:** The software isn't easy to use and inexperienced editors will find it difficult to use at first.

Lightworks Resolve may not be as popular as Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro, but that doesn't mean that this video editing software isn't as capable as its more popular counterparts.

The software is compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux OS, which makes it a perfect choice for Chromebook users that have a Linux OS installed on their devices. Lightworks features literally every editing tool imaginable and for that reason, it is a perfect choice for editing videos you would like to upload to Vimeo or YouTube or high-end professional projects. This editing software offers plenty of transitions and visual effects that will help its users to create seamless jumps between shots and visually impressive videos.

Chromebooks are an excellent choice for educational institutions or businesses that require their employees to have constant access to the Internet. Even though these devices are a perfect tool that can accompany you on business trips and enable you to answer important emails or have access to crucial information stored on the cloud, performing more demanding tasks, like video editing, is still a challenge. However, it is far from impossible, although you may have to take a few extra steps before running a video editing software on your Chromebook.

Chrome OS is a Linux based environment and for that reason, Chromebook owners who would like to use professional editing software on their Chromebooks can install a Linux OS that will enable them to use programs such as Lightworks that are perfectly suited for high-end video editing. There are two different ways to install Linux on a Chromebook, you can either do it using Gallium OS or ChrUbuntu or in a Chroot environment using Crouton. Each of these methods is relatively easy and we will take you through the process step by step. Here's how you can install Linux on your Chromebook.

* [Part 1: Preparing before installing Linux OS on Chromebook](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using ChrUbuntu](#part3)
* [Part 4: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook](#part4)
* [Part 5: Recommended Linux Video Editing Software](#part5)

## Part 1: Preparing before installing Linux OS on Chromebook

The first step of the process of installing the Linux OS is the decision itself, and you need to have all the necessary information before you decide to install a Linux OS on your Chromebook.

* Make sure that the version of Chromebook you have is capable of supporting a Linux OS. Your device must be equipped with an ARM or Intel chip in order to be able to run the version of Linux OS you want to install. Although both chips will allow you to go through the process, running closed source software such the Steam is only possible with Intel chips.
* Regardless of which method of installing Linux OS you choose, you will have to switch to the Developer Mode, a special built-in function that allows you to install the unapproved operating system, among other things.
* Now that you are aware of the requirements and risks, you will have to backup all the files you have on your Chromebook because once you switch to the Developer Mode all the information stored locally will be erased. You can save the files on another computer or on the cloud depending on how much data you need to move and which one is more convenient for you.

## Part 2: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook

After you have stored all your data safely, your Chromebook is ready for the beginning of the installation process of the secondary operating system. You will have to perform a series of actions that will allow you to start the installation, starting from accessing the Developer Mode.

#### 1. Acessing the developer mode

The first step of the process is to reboot your system, while your Chromebook is on. In order to do so hold Escape and Refresh keys on your keyboard and then hit the power button. Once your device is back online you will find yourself in the recovery mode, and you will see a message telling you to insert a recovery disc. Instead of inserting the disc, hold Ctrl+D and wait for OS verification menu to appear on the screen. At this point, if you are still having second thoughts about this process, you can hit the spacebar to return to recovery mode, or press Enter to proceed. Hitting Enter will delete all the data stored on your device and take you into the Developer Mode. Once your Chromebook lets you know that you are now in the Developer Mode, reboot the system and install a fresh version of the Chrome OS. Insert your login information and follow the instructions until you are looking at the Chrome OS desktop.

![Install Linux on Chromebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-1.jpg)

#### 2. Installing Chroot

At this stage of the process, your Chromebook is ready for the installation of the Crouton environment. Crouton is a series of scripts that makes running a Linux OS much easier, especially for inexperienced users. In order to download Crouton, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) and find the download link, detailed instructions or extensions that can add more functionality to your OS. Once the installation file or files are in the Download folder, your next step is to access the Chromebook's terminal a feature called 'Crosh'. The fastest way to do this is to hold CTRL + ALT keys and then hit the T key. This action will cause the Chrome window to appear on the screen, and you will need to type the 'shell' command without using quotation marks. Afterwards, enter the following command: 'sudo sh \~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce' and if you want to install extensions you will have to add 'xfce,extension' command at the end.

![Install Linux on Chromebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-2.jpg)

Press the Enter key and wait for the system to start setting up the Chroot. This process may take a while, so it is important to be patient, but more importantly, do not interfere with it in any way. Installation of your secondary OS is now on the way, and you may be asked to insert your login data, like your Gmail username and password. Wait patiently until the process is over and then return to shell and enter this command: 'sudo enter-chroot startxfce4'. Your screen will go black for a while, but after the black screen is gone your Chromebook will be in the freshly installed Linux OS.

#### 3. Optimizing your new OS

You may have to optimize your new OS in order to improve the experience of using it. Enabling your keyboard's brightness and volume keys inside the new OS can be done easily by holding CTRL+ALT+T and then typing shell once you've accessed Chrome OS's shell and hit Enter. Issue the following command: 'sudo sh -e \~/Downloads/crouton-r precise-t keyboard–u' and then press Enter again. Removing the screen saver or installing more extensions may also be a good way to enable more options in the new OS. Most importantly, you can now download and install the video editing software you want to use for editing your footage.

#### 4. Remove Chroot from your Chromebook

If for some reason you want to uninstall Linux from your Chromebook, simply reboot the system and press the spacebar when the 'OS verification is off' message appears on the screen. In this manner, you will exit the Developer Mode and all locally stored data, including all installed environments, will be deleted.

## Part 3: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using ChrUbuntu

An alternative option is available for Chromebook users that have Intel based devices like recently released Haswell models. The ChrUbuntu can be installed on the USB stick or external hard-drive or directly to the local memory of your Chromebook. Even though ARM-based machines can also use ChrUbuntu it isn't advisable because they may perform poorly due to slower processor speeds and less RAM power. Unlike Chroot, ChrUbuntu will not allow you to switch between operating systems without a reboot, and if the system is stored locally, you may need to go through the full system recovery.

#### 1. Preparation for the installation

Like with the previous method you will have to go into the Developer Mode and make sure that you have access to a WiFi connection. When you are asked to provide your login details, instead of entering them press Ctrl+Alt+Forward and then type 'chronos' and press Enter. The next step will require you to issue the following command: 'curl -L -O <http://goo.gl/9sgchs>; sudo bash 9sgchs' and then once more hit Enter. Again press Enter after the information about the installation is displayed on the screen and then you will be asked to decide how much space you want to allocate for Linux installation. Experts say that 9GB is the upper limit. After you've made your choice press Enter.

#### 2. Installing ChrUbuntu

Once the partitioning of your hard-drive is completed, you will have to repeat the first several steps from typing 'chronos' to pressing enter when information about the installation is displayed on the screen. The installation process is now in progress and you will be occasionally asked to select a few settings, make sure you always click on default. At the end of the installation process, you will have to choose the location where GRUB should be installed, please select /dev/sda, because the failure to do so may interrupt the installation.

Once the installation is completed, restart your Chromebook to finalize the process, and when you see the 'OS Verification is Off' notification press Ctrl+L to access Linux or Ctrl+D boot into Chrome OS.

![Install Linux on Chromebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-3.jpg)

#### 3. Uninstall ChrUbuntu

Removing ChrUbuntu is a relatively painless process that can be completed with just a few simple commands. If the OS is stored locally the only way to erase it is to perform a full system recovery. While all your data located on the cloud will re-sync with your Chromebook, the data stored locally will be deleted, which is why it is important to backup all the important files before starting a system recovery process. The fastest and easiest way to perform a system recovery is by creating a recovery disk from your device. Insert 'chrome://imageburner' in your browser's address bar, and carefully read and follow the instructions.

This Linux removal method will also require you to have a USB stick with a minimum of 4GB of storage space. After you created the disk, you can go into the Recovery Mode, by holding Esc and Refresh buttons simultaneously and then pressing the Power button. In the Recovery Mode, you will be asked to insert the recovery disk and the process will be on the way.

## Part 4: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using Gallium OS

If neither Chroot nor ChrUbuntu work for you, using Gallium OS may be the right choice. The Gallium is Xbuntu-based OS that is equipped with touchpad mouse drivers among other advantages it offers over other operating systems. The installation process isn't complicated, although it may require more effort than installing Crouton.

#### 1. Preparation for the installation

In order to be aware of all the preparation steps, you need to take, you must first find out your device's Hardware ID number and you can obtain this information by navigating to Chrome://System, Hardware Class within the Chrome OS. [Hardware Compatibility](https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware%5FCompatibility) page will provide the information regarding the CPU's family, which can be crucial for the OS' performance. You can run the installation either from an ISO image on an external USB drive or from the Chrome OS command line using Chrx. We will describe how to install Gallium OS from the Chrome OS command line because the other option doesn't allow you to dual-boot your Chromebook.

#### 2. Enabling the Legacy Mode

Like previously described, enter the Developer Mode and when the ' OS verification is OFF' notification appears on the screen proceed to enable the Legacy Mode. You can do this by holding CTRL+D keys to enable the Chrome OS to boot in the Developer Mode. After you've successfully made this step, press CTRl+ALT+T to access the 'Crosh' terminal and then type 'shell'. At the 'chronos/localhost/$ issue the following command: 'sudo crossystem dev\_boot\_legacy=1'. Update and install all the necessary firmware by running the Firmware Utility Script.

#### 3. Installation process

If you choose to install Gallium OS through Chrome OS command line using Chrx that will enable you to dual-boot your Chromebook, you should start by booting the device into Chrome OS and configuring networking. The next step you'll need to take is switching to a virtual terminal by holding Ctrl+Alt+F2, and then you should log in as user chronos without a password. Once you've completed this step issue the following command: 'curl -O <https://chrx.org/go> && sh go' and follow the on-screen instructions to repartition your hard-drive and install the Gallium OS. Once the installation is over reboot the device and press Ctrl+L when the 'OS Verification is Off' notification appears on the screen to boot Gallium OS or hold Ctrl+D to access Chrome OS. After the Gallium OS is successfully installed on your Chromebook you can start using programs such as Skype or Lightworks.

#### Which Method is the Best?

Each of the options to install a Linux OS on your Chromebook we described has its advantages and disadvantages. It is our opinion that the Crouton method is the easiest and the fastest. Furthermore, this method enables you to switch between your primary and secondary OS without the need to reboot the device and the Downloads folder makes working in both environments much easier.

On the other hand, other methods require more knowledge about the Linux OS installation process and switching between OS' is not that simple. If you are looking for an easy way to dual-boot your Chromebook that best way to do it is to install Linux as a Chroot using Crouton.

Once the installation file or files are in the Download folder, your next step is to access the Chromebook's terminal a feature called 'Crosh'. The fastest way to do this is to hold CTRL + ALT keys and then hit the T key. This action will cause the Chrome window to appear on the screen, and you will need to type the 'shell' command without using quotation marks. Afterwards, enter the following command: 'sudo sh \~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce' and if you want to install extensions you will have to add 'xfce,extension' command at the end.

![Install Linux on Chromebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-2.jpg)

Press the Enter key and wait for the system to start setting up the Chroot. This process may take a while, so it is important to be patient, but more importantly, do not interfere with it in any way. Installation of your secondary OS is now on the way, and you may be asked to insert your login data, like your Gmail username and password. Wait patiently until the process is over and then return to shell and enter this command: 'sudo enter-chroot startxfce4'. Your screen will go black for a while, but after the black screen is gone your Chromebook will be in the freshly installed Linux OS.

#### 3. Optimizing your new OS

You may have to optimize your new OS in order to improve the experience of using it. Enabling your keyboard's brightness and volume keys inside the new OS can be done easily by holding CTRL+ALT+T and then typing shell once you've accessed Chrome OS's shell and hit Enter. Issue the following command: 'sudo sh -e \~/Downloads/crouton-r precise-t keyboard–u' and then press Enter again. Removing the screen saver or installing more extensions may also be a good way to enable more options in the new OS. Most importantly, you can now download and install the video editing software you want to use for editing your footage.

#### 4. Remove Chroot from your Chromebook

If for some reason you want to uninstall Linux from your Chromebook, simply reboot the system and press the spacebar when the 'OS verification is off' message appears on the screen. In this manner, you will exit the Developer Mode and all locally stored data, including all installed environments, will be deleted.

## Part 3: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using ChrUbuntu

An alternative option is available for Chromebook users that have Intel based devices like recently released Haswell models. The ChrUbuntu can be installed on the USB stick or external hard-drive or directly to the local memory of your Chromebook. Even though ARM-based machines can also use ChrUbuntu it isn't advisable because they may perform poorly due to slower processor speeds and less RAM power. Unlike Chroot, ChrUbuntu will not allow you to switch between operating systems without a reboot, and if the system is stored locally, you may need to go through the full system recovery.

#### 1. Preparation for the installation

Like with the previous method you will have to go into the Developer Mode and make sure that you have access to a WiFi connection. When you are asked to provide your login details, instead of entering them press Ctrl+Alt+Forward and then type 'chronos' and press Enter. The next step will require you to issue the following command: 'curl -L -O <http://goo.gl/9sgchs>; sudo bash 9sgchs' and then once more hit Enter. Again press Enter after the information about the installation is displayed on the screen and then you will be asked to decide how much space you want to allocate for Linux installation. Experts say that 9GB is the upper limit. After you've made your choice press Enter.

#### 2. Installing ChrUbuntu

Once the partitioning of your hard-drive is completed, you will have to repeat the first several steps from typing 'chronos' to pressing enter when information about the installation is displayed on the screen. The installation process is now in progress and you will be occasionally asked to select a few settings, make sure you always click on default. At the end of the installation process, you will have to choose the location where GRUB should be installed, please select /dev/sda, because the failure to do so may interrupt the installation.

Once the installation is completed, restart your Chromebook to finalize the process, and when you see the 'OS Verification is Off' notification press Ctrl+L to access Linux or Ctrl+D boot into Chrome OS.

![Install Linux on Chromebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-3.jpg)

#### 3. Uninstall ChrUbuntu

Removing ChrUbuntu is a relatively painless process that can be completed with just a few simple commands. If the OS is stored locally the only way to erase it is to perform a full system recovery. While all your data located on the cloud will re-sync with your Chromebook, the data stored locally will be deleted, which is why it is important to backup all the important files before starting a system recovery process. The fastest and easiest way to perform a system recovery is by creating a recovery disk from your device. Insert 'chrome://imageburner' in your browser's address bar, and carefully read and follow the instructions.

This Linux removal method will also require you to have a USB stick with a minimum of 4GB of storage space. After you created the disk, you can go into the Recovery Mode, by holding Esc and Refresh buttons simultaneously and then pressing the Power button. In the Recovery Mode, you will be asked to insert the recovery disk and the process will be on the way.

## Part 4: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using Gallium OS

If neither Chroot nor ChrUbuntu work for you, using Gallium OS may be the right choice. The Gallium is Xbuntu-based OS that is equipped with touchpad mouse drivers among other advantages it offers over other operating systems. The installation process isn't complicated, although it may require more effort than installing Crouton.

#### 1. Preparation for the installation

In order to be aware of all the preparation steps, you need to take, you must first find out your device's Hardware ID number and you can obtain this information by navigating to Chrome://System, Hardware Class within the Chrome OS. [Hardware Compatibility](https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware%5FCompatibility) page will provide the information regarding the CPU's family, which can be crucial for the OS' performance. You can run the installation either from an ISO image on an external USB drive or from the Chrome OS command line using Chrx. We will describe how to install Gallium OS from the Chrome OS command line because the other option doesn't allow you to dual-boot your Chromebook.

#### 2. Enabling the Legacy Mode

Like previously described, enter the Developer Mode and when the ' OS verification is OFF' notification appears on the screen proceed to enable the Legacy Mode. You can do this by holding CTRL+D keys to enable the Chrome OS to boot in the Developer Mode. After you've successfully made this step, press CTRl+ALT+T to access the 'Crosh' terminal and then type 'shell'. At the 'chronos/localhost/$ issue the following command: 'sudo crossystem dev\_boot\_legacy=1'. Update and install all the necessary firmware by running the Firmware Utility Script.

#### 3. Installation process

If you choose to install Gallium OS through Chrome OS command line using Chrx that will enable you to dual-boot your Chromebook, you should start by booting the device into Chrome OS and configuring networking. The next step you'll need to take is switching to a virtual terminal by holding Ctrl+Alt+F2, and then you should log in as user chronos without a password. Once you've completed this step issue the following command: 'curl -O <https://chrx.org/go> && sh go' and follow the on-screen instructions to repartition your hard-drive and install the Gallium OS. Once the installation is over reboot the device and press Ctrl+L when the 'OS Verification is Off' notification appears on the screen to boot Gallium OS or hold Ctrl+D to access Chrome OS. After the Gallium OS is successfully installed on your Chromebook you can start using programs such as Skype or Lightworks.

#### Which Method is the Best?

Each of the options to install a Linux OS on your Chromebook we described has its advantages and disadvantages. It is our opinion that the Crouton method is the easiest and the fastest. Furthermore, this method enables you to switch between your primary and secondary OS without the need to reboot the device and the Downloads folder makes working in both environments much easier.

On the other hand, other methods require more knowledge about the Linux OS installation process and switching between OS' is not that simple. If you are looking for an easy way to dual-boot your Chromebook that best way to do it is to install Linux as a Chroot using Crouton.

## Part 5: Recommended Linux Video Editing Software: Lightworks

**Price:** $24.99/month, although free versions of the software are also available.

**What we like:** A powerful video and audio editor perfectly suited for the production of professional video content.

**What we don't like:** The software isn't easy to use and inexperienced editors will find it difficult to use at first.

Lightworks Resolve may not be as popular as Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro, but that doesn't mean that this video editing software isn't as capable as its more popular counterparts.

The software is compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux OS, which makes it a perfect choice for Chromebook users that have a Linux OS installed on their devices. Lightworks features literally every editing tool imaginable and for that reason, it is a perfect choice for editing videos you would like to upload to Vimeo or YouTube or high-end professional projects. This editing software offers plenty of transitions and visual effects that will help its users to create seamless jumps between shots and visually impressive videos.

# VLC Trimmer Mac: Best Way to Trim VLC Without Losing Quality

_Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?_ Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.

In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.

* [Section 1\. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality](#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality)
* [Section 2\. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality](#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality)

## Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?

To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!

#### 1\. Codec

Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.

#### 2\. Container

A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.

Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.

#### 3\. Video compression and re-encoding

You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.

When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. **Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.**

The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.

When you make changes to a video with a **video trimmer app**, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.

If you want to trim your video manually, you can just drag the trimming sliders according to how you want to cut the video.

![lossescut for trimming VLC video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/lossescut.jpg)

One unique feature of LosslessCut is that it lets you take JPEG screenshots of the video. It also has a portable version that doesn’t require any installation and can be started directly from a USB.

* Pros: LosslessCut works best with mobile videos or action cams like GoPro.
* Cons: It supports a whole range of video formats, but don’t expect to edit 4K videos using this software. It’s simple and easy to use for a reason.

### 3. Trimming VLC via [TunesKit Video Converter](https://www.tuneskit.com/video-cutter-for-win.html)

TunesKit is a simple video trimmer software that’s available on both Mac and Windows. Unlike Filmora and LosslessCut, TunesKit supports a very limited number of video formats. It is mainly an MP4 video cutter. It works at a much faster speed and there is no loss of quality.

![tuneskit to trim vlc video without lossing quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/tuneskit.jpg)

* Pros: The interface, while simpler than Filmora’s, can seem a bit confusing sometimes. TunesKit also has a video editor, which lets you add effects to different segments of the trimmed video, a feature that you probably won’t be using very often. To trim VLC videos in MP4 without re-encoding, you simply have to drag the slider that appears when you import your video.
* Cons: However, its functions may not be as rich as Filmora.

#### Conclusion

If you trim your VLC video, it will result in data loss, which will lead to a reduction in quality. Losing quality is inevitable with most video editors, which is why you should [Download Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as it's easy to use and has the best and most useful features.

Filmora supports many popular formats like MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and also different screen resolutions so no matter what the format of your VLC video is, you can easily divide it by scenes using the Scene Detection feature and quickly turn those scenes into clips.

_Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?_ Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.

In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.

* [Section 1\. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality](#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality)
* [Section 2\. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality](#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality)

## Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?

To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!

#### 1\. Codec

Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.

#### 2\. Container

A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.

Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.

#### 3\. Video compression and re-encoding

You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.

When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. **Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.**

The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.

When you make changes to a video with a **video trimmer app**, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.
