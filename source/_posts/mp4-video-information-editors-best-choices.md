Adding subtitles or selecting the audio track of a video file is easy and optionally you can search through the DVD player’s subtitle library if the original video doesn’t have built-in subtitles.

### 10\. [Macgo Windows Blu-ray](https://www.macblurayplayer.com/windows-bluray-player.htm#specs)

Even though this media player is primarily designed for macOS, the manufacturer announced that the Windows version of the app is going to become available soon. The Macgo Windows Blu-ray player is expected to offer support for a broad range of Blu-ray file formats and video files, which should enable its users to watch or listen to content without any restrictions. The media player can also display a variety of photo file formats, including CR2 files, and its users can utilize it to browse through their photo collections and ever view RAW files.

The current Mac-based versions of the software offer support for Dolby TrueHD Audio DTS-HD Master Audio and DTS 5.1 codecs that ensure you can hear every sound in a video accurately. Macgo Windows Blu-ray should also be equipped with a range of subtitle options that allow you to customize the color, size or the font of a video’s subtitles.

**Pros**

* Supports nearly all Blu-ray and video file formats
* Powerful audio playback features
* Displays image files
* Offers online video playback options

**Cons**

* This Blu-ray and DVD player is still in Beta stage

**Conclusion**

Media players like Pot Player or VLC are powerful enough to provide smooth playback of all audio and video files for free, while DVD players like PowerDVD or KMPlayer are a better option if you are looking for a true home theater experience.
