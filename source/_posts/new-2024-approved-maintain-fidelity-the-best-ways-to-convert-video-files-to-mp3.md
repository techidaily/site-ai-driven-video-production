#### 5. [Adobe Premiere Pro CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

The Remix feature lets you combine photos and videos into a single file instantly, and it can be quite useful if you’re just looking for a way to quickly make a video. Despite some attractive video editing tools, the Microsoft Photos app remains an option best suited for beginners.
