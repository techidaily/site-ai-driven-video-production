The blurred background is meant to keep your focal point at the absolute center of your audience’s attention.

Blur photo uses a one click method to achieve auto blurred backgrounds to help you achieve the Bokeh effect. It also allows you to manually adjust the settings to your own liking. Users can increase or decrease the blur effect, add filters to photos, and add emojis and text.

To create the Bokeh effect in PhotoDirector:

To create the Bokeh effect in Tadaa SLR:

1. Download the app and allow the app access to your camera and camera roll, and then select the image given your options (camera, camera roll);
2. Once image is imported, select the **Mask** tool, which you can use to select the portion of the image you’d like to keep in focus;
3. You may then adjust the aperture, range, gloss and highlights via the modification tools provided at the bottom of the screen.
4. Adjust to your liking and export!

## Part 3: Creating the Bokeh Effect Using the Portrait Mode Function on Your iPhone

If using a third-party app seems like too much effort, or you don’t find the app that achieves the exact blur to focus ratio you’re looking for, consider using the Portrait Mode feature available on newer iPhone models.

Portrait mode is a camera function that allows users to create the depth of field effect we know as Bokeh. When used, the focal image will be crisp and sharp, while the background will be blurred nicely so as to not cause a distraction to the focal point.

To achieve the Bokeh effect through Portrait Mode, you must:

1. Open up your camera app and along the bottom of your screen find and select **Portrait**, and select from a variety of portrait mode options, including Natural light, studio light, contour light, stage light, stage light mono, high key light mono;

![add bokeh effects with Portrait Mode on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-portrait-mode-option.jpg)

1. Portrait mode will then allow you to choose your focal point, and do the rest of the work when it comes to blurring the background to create the Bokeh effect;
2. The different modes offered will allow users to achieve different types of blur.

Note: If you want to add the bokeh effect to video on the desktop computer, you should try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which provides tilt-shift circle and tilt-shift linear effects for creating the bokeh effect, as well as some bokeh effect overlay. For more details, you can check [how to add bokeh effects to the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with Filmora.

**Takeaway**

Using the Bokeh effect can add a layer to your photography that takes it to the next level. While there are a variety of tools you can use to achieve this, I have covered the 10 best apps for iOS and Android users to accomplish Bokeh. And if third-party apps aren’t for you, don’t forget that iPhone user can also use Portrait Mode to achieve a great Bokeh outcome.
