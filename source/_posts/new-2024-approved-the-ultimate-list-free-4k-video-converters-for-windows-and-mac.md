We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue [why 4K is better than 1080P](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The 4k technology allows the users to enjoy a very detailed screen of movies and videos which was not possible before. Though there are some 4K devices just as what we have rated before such as [4K TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K smartphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K monitor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and[4K camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) nowadays, 4k being relatively new, not all people have access to 4K devices and sometimes, and there are rather limited options to play 4K videos in a [4k video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). 4k being relatively new, there are not many devices that support 4k and rather limited options to play these videos in a 4k video player.

Since uploading 4K videos to online video converters may take much time, so in this article, we will share some of the best 4K video converters that allow you to convert 4K to 1080P resolution or other resolutions in MP4, MOV, MKV or other formats easily on Windows and Mac only.

While we’ve updated the list of best 4K video converters and add some more Video Converters that support 4K resolution. Both of them support Windows and Mac versions, and some of them are totally free to use while others may need to pay to convert 4K video footage.

### 4k vs 1080p

It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?

**Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?**

The answer is **Yes**, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.

![4kvs1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4kvs1080.png)

Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.

So do not wait…

Let us dive into the detail:

### What is a 4k?

As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has **3840 x 2160px** or **4096 x 2160** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.

![4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4k.png)

**Pros**

* When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.
* It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.
* It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.
* If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.  
**Cons**
* It occupies more space on your camera.
* It is harder to record.
* It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.
* There is limited content for 4k videos.  

### What is a1080p?  

As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has **1920 x 1080px** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.  
![1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/1080.png)  
**Pros**

* You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.
* It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.
* It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).
* It has a much better focus than 4k.
* Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.
* 1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. **Cons**
* Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.
* It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.
* You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.  
![scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/scale.png)  
In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.

We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue [why 4K is better than 1080P](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The 4k technology allows the users to enjoy a very detailed screen of movies and videos which was not possible before. Though there are some 4K devices just as what we have rated before such as [4K TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K smartphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K monitor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and[4K camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) nowadays, 4k being relatively new, not all people have access to 4K devices and sometimes, and there are rather limited options to play 4K videos in a [4k video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). 4k being relatively new, there are not many devices that support 4k and rather limited options to play these videos in a 4k video player.

Since uploading 4K videos to online video converters may take much time, so in this article, we will share some of the best 4K video converters that allow you to convert 4K to 1080P resolution or other resolutions in MP4, MOV, MKV or other formats easily on Windows and Mac only.

While we’ve updated the list of best 4K video converters and add some more Video Converters that support 4K resolution. Both of them support Windows and Mac versions, and some of them are totally free to use while others may need to pay to convert 4K video footage.

### 4k vs 1080p

It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?

**Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?**

The answer is **Yes**, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.

![4kvs1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4kvs1080.png)

Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.

So do not wait…

Let us dive into the detail:

### What is a 4k?

As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has **3840 x 2160px** or **4096 x 2160** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.

![4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4k.png)

**Pros**

* When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.
* It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.
* It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.
* If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.  
**Cons**
* It occupies more space on your camera.
* It is harder to record.
* It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.
* There is limited content for 4k videos.  

### What is a1080p?  

As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has **1920 x 1080px** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.  
![1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/1080.png)  
**Pros**

* You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.
* It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.
* It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).
* It has a much better focus than 4k.
* Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.
* 1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. **Cons**
* Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.
* It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.
* You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.  
![scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/scale.png)  
In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.

We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue [why 4K is better than 1080P](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The 4k technology allows the users to enjoy a very detailed screen of movies and videos which was not possible before. Though there are some 4K devices just as what we have rated before such as [4K TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K smartphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K monitor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and[4K camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) nowadays, 4k being relatively new, not all people have access to 4K devices and sometimes, and there are rather limited options to play 4K videos in a [4k video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). 4k being relatively new, there are not many devices that support 4k and rather limited options to play these videos in a 4k video player.

Since uploading 4K videos to online video converters may take much time, so in this article, we will share some of the best 4K video converters that allow you to convert 4K to 1080P resolution or other resolutions in MP4, MOV, MKV or other formats easily on Windows and Mac only. You can check the detailed information about downloading and [converting 4k video footage to mp4](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) here.

While we’ve updated the list of best 4K video converters and add some more Video Converters that support 4K resolution. Both of them support Windows and Mac versions, and some of them are totally free to use while others may need to pay to convert 4K video footage.

### 4k vs 1080p

It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?

**Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?**

The answer is **Yes**, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.

![4kvs1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4kvs1080.png)

Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.

So do not wait…

Let us dive into the detail:

### What is a 4k?

As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has **3840 x 2160px** or **4096 x 2160** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.

![4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4k.png)

**Pros**

* When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.
* It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.
* It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.
* If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.  
**Cons**
* It occupies more space on your camera.
* It is harder to record.
* It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.
* There is limited content for 4k videos.  

### What is a1080p?  

As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has **1920 x 1080px** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.  
![1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/1080.png)  
**Pros**

* You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.
* It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.
* It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).
* It has a much better focus than 4k.
* Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.
* 1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. **Cons**
* Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.
* It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.
* You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.  
![scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/scale.png)  
In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.

L-cut is exactly opposite to J-cut where the audio from the next scene overlays the image from the next scene to play the audio after an image has been displayed in the video.

## Basic Video Editing Terms You Should Know

Below are some of the important yet basic terms that you should know related to videography in general and video editing in specific as well, whether you are a beginner or professional.

**Aspect ratio:**

The aspect ratio is the ratio of width and height of a video. Examples of the most used aspect ratios are: 4:3, 16:9, 1.85:1.

Refer to the image given below for a better understanding.

![aspec ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/aspec-ratio.jpg)

**B-roll:**

B-roll facilities one with the flexibility, when editing, to the video editing rules as it is an add-on picture that makes a previously incoherent scene seamless.

As shown in the image below, B-roll is used to insert which can make the transition easy to look on the eyes.

**Bit rate:**

Bit rate, also known as data rate, refers to the amount of data used for every second within the video. It is most commonly expressed in kilobits per second (kbps).

**Close up:**

Close-up refers to the shots that frame to subject tightly.

For instance, if it is a person, then the close-up covers solely his face.

**Color temperature:**

Color temperature refers to the light visibility in a shot. Color temperature is expressed in Kelvin. The scale of color temperature ranges from cool to warm.

![color temperature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/color-temperature.jpg)

**Composition:**

Composition entails the process of combining multiple footages using video editing software.

**Compression:**

Compression is the process of minimizing the quantity of data utilized in a video file. It helps make in the process of uploading and downloading quite faster. This also leaves you with ample space for more of your publications.

**Crop factor:**

Crop factor refers to a number that expresses the ratio of the imaging area of a sensor to a full-frame sensor. It typically ranges from 1.3 to 2.0.

**Cut-in**

Cut-in refers to showing a specific part of a subject in order to emphasize a certain aspect or emotion. For instance, hand gestures may show nervousness, enthusiasm, agitation, etc.

**Foley:**

Often times the original sound of the scene captured in the video is not captured as naturally as they were supposed to sound like in reality. Hence, Foley is when you reproduce those sounds for that video.

**Frame rate:**

Frame rate refers to the video capturing by a shutter in a second or shutter cycling rate through opening and closing. Some of the common frame rates are 24, 25, 29.97, 30, etc. The frame rate is expressed in frames per second (fps).

**High definition media interface:**

HDMI is the connectors that digitally transfer audio and HD video to a television. This is helpful if you intend to work on a bigger screen or wish to share some of your productions.

**Resolution:**

Resolution refers to the horizontal and vertical pixels of your video. For instance 640×480 for SD and 1280×720 for HD. Sometimes resolution refers only to the number of pixels that paper vertically. For example 480p, 720p, and 1080p respectively.

![resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resolution.jpg)

**J-Cut:**

J-cut refers to the editing technique in which the audio from a next scene is overlapped with the image from the previous scene, such that the audio segment of the next scene begins playing prior to its picture.

**Jumpcut:**

Jumpcut editing techniques refer to an abrupt transition between the two consecutive frames. The entity in the video containing jump cuts appears to jump along with the scene from one place to another. This looks disruptive to the audience.

**L-Cut:**

L-cut is exactly opposite to J-cut where the audio from the next scene overlays the image from the next scene to play the audio after an image has been displayed in the video.

**Lower third:**

As the name suggests, the lower third is derived from the rule of third which refers to the type of title, mostly used by vloggers, broadcasters, interviewers, and you tubers.

**Memory bank**:

You can understand the term by thinking of a memory box where we keep certain things as a memory of the events in someone’s life. Memory bank serves the same purpose through the use of video. It often uses natural sounds, document travel or merely store moments in routine life.

**Press kit:**

Press kit is used to provide information regarding your productions to the press for promotional purposes. Such information is often background including synopsis, crew, cast’s bios Q&A with the director, production stills and its reviews.

**Shot list:**

The shot list refers to the checklist related to the shots that a videographer plans to include in his/her content. This may help you save time and gear with efficient planning and handling. This gives a sense of direction to your production.

**Storyboard:**

A storyboard is a drawing to illustrate the scenes in the video. This gives a direct and organized way to visualize the needs for the shots or animation.

![storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/storyboard.jpg)

**Sync:**

Synchronization, aka sync, refers to the alignment of audio with video imaging.

**Rule of thirds:**

The rule of third is a grid that helps you to compose interesting and balanced shots to make your productions aesthetically pleasing. The grid is similar to a tic-tac-toe board since it segregates the picture into 9 segments. It helps bring points of interest to be aligned with the lines or intersection given in the grid.

![rule of thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/rule-of-thirds.jpg)

**Three-point lighting:**

This helps one to diminish the shadows for image balancing and provides an appealing contrast. These three lights are commonly known as fill, key, and backlight.

![three point lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/three-point-lighting.jpg)

**Tilts:**

Tilts refer to the vertical transitions that your camera. This is the opposite of pans.

![tilts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/tilts.jpg)

**Pans:**

Pans refer to the horizontal movements of your camera. This is exactly contrary to tilts.

**White balance:**

White balance refers to the process where the unrealistic color casts are removed in order to render a white object to be actually white in your photo, and not have other tints.

![white balance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/white-balance.jpg)

**Wide-angle:**

A wide-angel lens refers to a short focal length of a lens. This brings more of a subject rather than a subject being captured by a normal lens at equal distances.

![wide angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/wide-angle.jpg)

**Non-linear editing:**

NLEs is a non-destructive editing technique that allows one to access any frame in a video clip regardless of the sequence in the clip. It gives you the freedom to easily include effects, transitions, fades, etc. which cannot be achieved with linear editing

**Pixel aspect ratio:**

Pixels are several tiny squares that build up an image in a video. Whereas, aspect ratio refers to the ratio of width to height of a video. Hence, the pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the ratio of width to height of the pixels.

## Conclusion

Be it Instagram stories, YouTube product testimonials, or Facebook ads, using these easy-to-use video editing software will elevate your content into a professional and slick look.

So, I hope you are now ready to get started.

## Unleash Your Creativity: Top PowerDirector Alternatives for Android and iOS

# Best PowerDirector Alternatives for Android and iOS

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Video editing was once exclusively the realm of the PC, but with the power of modern smartphones and tablets even professionals are more frequently editing on the go. This should come as no surprise as most of our photos and footage are stored on mobile devices, while apps like PowerDirector give the full functionality of a professional editing suite on mobile technology.

Currently PowerDirector is only available on Android, but if you’re using an iOS device you’re sadly missing out. Luckily there are several alternative apps that allow you to edit your footage from a mobile device; see our reviews below.

## Best PowerDirector Alternatives for Android and iOS

#### 1\. [Kinemaster](https://www.kinemaster.com/index.php?lang=en) \- £2.91 per month

System: Android, iOS

Kinemaster is an impressive app that brings simplicity to complex professional editing tools, making it easy to use even on a small screen. It supports multiple layers including unlimited text, handwriting and sticker layers, as well as up to two video layers and four additional audio tracks. The precision editing features allow you edit frame by frame and it’s easy to quickly import extra footage and add additional effects. With a host of other features we haven’t mentioned it’s amazing how simple this app is. The only downside is the pricing model; instead of a one-off payment you’re saddled with £2.91 per month, an investment that could end up exceeding the value of the app.

#### 2\. [LumaFX](https://luma-touch.com/lumafx/) \- £2.99

System: iOS

LumaFX is a treasure trove of editing effects and goodies, allowing you to completely change the look of your video. The colour and FX sections of the app have a variety of filters and presets that allow you to do anything from fixing annoying colours to transforming your video into a psychedelic cartoon. The versatility of crop tools is also incredibly impressive, allowing you to crop your clip to different aspect ratios that can then be can be flipped and rotated, slowed down, reversed, and trimmed. Even if you decide on another more powerful editing app, the low cost and range of features of LumaFX makes it ideal for using in conjunction with your app of choice to produce the ultimate video content.

#### 3\. iMovie – Free

System: iOS

Every iOS user should be familiar with iMovie as it comes bundled on every apple device. Costing nothing is a big upside, especially when the technology handles as intuitively as it does. Splicing footage becomes laughably easy. On the audio side you can add music and personalised voiceovers to your videos and if you’re in the mood for something a little silly there are plenty of over the top TV templates and movie style themes. Accessibility is a big plus for iMovie, but it’s definitely geared to more casual users – professionals will find high end features lacking and should consider a more powerful paid alternative.

#### 4\. [Adobe Premiere Clip](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-clip.html) \- Free

System: Android, iOS

Another free offering, Adobe Premiere Clip shares many of both the benefits and flaws of iMovie. For the casual user its ideal, offering a straightforward means of arranging clips that’s predominantly designed for speed. The creative cloud allows you to continue editing on the desktop Premiere Pro making it a handy extension for existing Adobe customers. It’s also a much more compact download than iMovie; 91 MB compared to 600\. There’s a standard array of editing features including trimming and a basic title editor, as well as the option to export options to social sharing sites of your choice, but unless you already work within the creative cloud there’s limited reasons to choose this over the superior iMovie.

There really is no beating PowerDirector for Android, but iOS users should be able to find an app or combination of apps to allow them to continue editing on the move.

For the casual user its ideal, offering a straightforward means of arranging clips that’s predominantly designed for speed. The creative cloud allows you to continue editing on the desktop Premiere Pro making it a handy extension for existing Adobe customers. It’s also a much more compact download than iMovie; 91 MB compared to 600\. There’s a standard array of editing features including trimming and a basic title editor, as well as the option to export options to social sharing sites of your choice, but unless you already work within the creative cloud there’s limited reasons to choose this over the superior iMovie.

There really is no beating PowerDirector for Android, but iOS users should be able to find an app or combination of apps to allow them to continue editing on the move.

Video editing was once exclusively the realm of the PC, but with the power of modern smartphones and tablets even professionals are more frequently editing on the go. This should come as no surprise as most of our photos and footage are stored on mobile devices, while apps like PowerDirector give the full functionality of a professional editing suite on mobile technology.

Currently PowerDirector is only available on Android, but if you’re using an iOS device you’re sadly missing out. Luckily there are several alternative apps that allow you to edit your footage from a mobile device; see our reviews below.

## Best PowerDirector Alternatives for Android and iOS

#### 1\. [Kinemaster](https://www.kinemaster.com/index.php?lang=en) \- £2.91 per month

System: Android, iOS

Kinemaster is an impressive app that brings simplicity to complex professional editing tools, making it easy to use even on a small screen. It supports multiple layers including unlimited text, handwriting and sticker layers, as well as up to two video layers and four additional audio tracks. The precision editing features allow you edit frame by frame and it’s easy to quickly import extra footage and add additional effects. With a host of other features we haven’t mentioned it’s amazing how simple this app is. The only downside is the pricing model; instead of a one-off payment you’re saddled with £2.91 per month, an investment that could end up exceeding the value of the app.

#### 2\. [LumaFX](https://luma-touch.com/lumafx/) \- £2.99

System: iOS

LumaFX is a treasure trove of editing effects and goodies, allowing you to completely change the look of your video. The colour and FX sections of the app have a variety of filters and presets that allow you to do anything from fixing annoying colours to transforming your video into a psychedelic cartoon. The versatility of crop tools is also incredibly impressive, allowing you to crop your clip to different aspect ratios that can then be can be flipped and rotated, slowed down, reversed, and trimmed. Even if you decide on another more powerful editing app, the low cost and range of features of LumaFX makes it ideal for using in conjunction with your app of choice to produce the ultimate video content.

#### 3\. iMovie – Free

System: iOS

Every iOS user should be familiar with iMovie as it comes bundled on every apple device. Costing nothing is a big upside, especially when the technology handles as intuitively as it does. Splicing footage becomes laughably easy. On the audio side you can add music and personalised voiceovers to your videos and if you’re in the mood for something a little silly there are plenty of over the top TV templates and movie style themes. Accessibility is a big plus for iMovie, but it’s definitely geared to more casual users – professionals will find high end features lacking and should consider a more powerful paid alternative.

#### 4\. [Adobe Premiere Clip](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-clip.html) \- Free

System: Android, iOS

Another free offering, Adobe Premiere Clip shares many of both the benefits and flaws of iMovie. For the casual user its ideal, offering a straightforward means of arranging clips that’s predominantly designed for speed. The creative cloud allows you to continue editing on the desktop Premiere Pro making it a handy extension for existing Adobe customers. It’s also a much more compact download than iMovie; 91 MB compared to 600\. There’s a standard array of editing features including trimming and a basic title editor, as well as the option to export options to social sharing sites of your choice, but unless you already work within the creative cloud there’s limited reasons to choose this over the superior iMovie.
