 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.

Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.

Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can't miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Note: in the free trial version of Filmora 11, there will be a watermark like most online video editors listed below. But you’re allowed to use all the features and effects and save it to your computer or share it on YouTube or Vimeo directly. If you’re a teacher or a student or school staff, you can enjoy our [discount](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on purchasing.

I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.

### #5\. Wideo

![Wideo Online Animated Video Editor Editing Panel ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wideo-online-animated-video-maker.jpg)

Wideo is an online video creating site for **creating animated videos, explainer videos** and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. **Sign in first** to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website's editing service, create a sequence of animations.

Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to **upload your own images** in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.

What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose **video aspect ratio** such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are **a lot of video templates** available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19/mo to 79/mo.

However, if you want to **download** the video on your computer, you’ll **need to upgrade your plan**. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn't a free option for you.

### #6\. PowToon

![Wideo Online Animated Video Editor Editing Panel ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powtoon-online-animated-video-maker.jpg)

The drag and drop style editing leaves you with a video reminiscent of the Common Craft style.

You **need to sign in** to use this online, and it provides **many video templates** available for different situations such as explainer video, marketing video, infographic video, video ads, and presentation.

### #7\. Video Toolbox

![Video Toolbox Online  Video Editor ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-toolbox-online-video-editor-interface.jpg)

Touted as the future of video editing, Video Toolbox is a free online platform that in addition to editing your video files analyses it and gives you highly detailed information about the bit rate, codec, frame rate, and resolution.

It can also **convert** your video file to the most popular video formats such as MKV, MOV, MP4, and AVI. This online platform allows you to upload videos from a computer or from a URL, it can now handle video files up to 1500MB and that still gives you a lot to play around with, and you can **merge, crop, or cut video** files. The editing features are **simple and limited** but it also allows you to record a webcam. One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.

You need to **sign up** and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is **outdated and not user-friendly** enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be **no real-time preview window** to check the editing progress.

### #12\. Online Video Cutter

![online video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though it isn't a video editor to some degree, this intuitive online video editing tool application appears user-friendly and it isn’t limited to cut videos as the name indicates. You can upload videos from computer or via Dropbox, Google Drive or URL directly. With this online video cutter, you can easily **rotate** the videos to 90, 180 or even 270 degrees, **crop** them, **trim** or apply several professional style editing features to create incredible projects.

It can easily handle the **maximum file size of 500MB** and allow users to access any popular media file format with ease. It is free to use and you can access all advanced features even without buying any license.

What I like about this online video editing tool is that **you don’t need to register to use** it and there is also **no watermark** in the saved video. But it would be greater if this online tool can integrate some music and effects as well.

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.

Wideo is an online video creating site for **creating animated videos, explainer videos** and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. **Sign in first** to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website's editing service, create a sequence of animations.

Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to **upload your own images** in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.

What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose **video aspect ratio** such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are **a lot of video templates** available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19/mo to 79/mo.

However, if you want to **download** the video on your computer, you’ll **need to upgrade your plan**. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn't a free option for you.

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.

Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.

Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can't miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.

But you’re allowed to use all the features and effects and save it to your computer or share it on YouTube or Vimeo directly.

### #12\. Online Video Cutter

![online video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though it isn't a video editor to some degree, this intuitive online video editing tool application appears user-friendly and it isn’t limited to cut videos as the name indicates. You can upload videos from computer or via Dropbox, Google Drive or URL directly. With this online video cutter, you can easily **rotate** the videos to 90, 180 or even 270 degrees, **crop** them, **trim** or apply several professional style editing features to create incredible projects. You can **save the video with the original quality or to 1080P Full HD**.

It can easily handle the **maximum file size of 500MB** and allow users to access any popular media file format with ease. It is free to use and you can access all advanced features even without buying any license.

What I like about this online video editing tool is that **you don’t need to register to use** it and there is also **no watermark** in the saved video. But it would be greater if this online tool can integrate some music and effects as well.

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.

With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.

Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.

Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can't miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Note: in the free trial version of Filmora 11, there will be a watermark like most online video editors listed below. But you’re allowed to use all the features and effects and save it to your computer or share it on YouTube or Vimeo directly. If you’re a teacher or a student or school staff, you can enjoy our [discount](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on purchasing.

## Top 10+ Best Free Online Video Editors

Though some online video editing tools listed below provide free trial versions, if you need to download the video, you may need to upgrade your free plan to the paid version.

### #2\. ClipChamp

![online video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Clipchamp is a well-known **free online video editing tool**, besides the video editing tools, it **provides a video compressor, converter, and webcam recorder** as well. The best part is that its **intuitive** work platform allows beginners to complete their video editing within very little time and the output can be directly saved on the computer or shared to Google Drive etc.

Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation.

You can select **different aspect ratios** such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides **a built-in guide** so you can make a video with it easily. However, you **need to sign up with your Google account or Facebook account** first before using this **all-in-one online video editor**. And the free version is **limited to export at the 480P SD** resolution with **no watermark**. Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the **video footage can’t be exported in 4K**. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.

Wideo is an online video creating site for **creating animated videos, explainer videos** and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. **Sign in first** to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website's editing service, create a sequence of animations.

Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to **upload your own images** in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.

What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose **video aspect ratio** such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are **a lot of video templates** available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19/mo to 79/mo.

However, if you want to **download** the video on your computer, you’ll **need to upgrade your plan**. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn't a free option for you.

## The Ultimate List: Best Public Domain Images Online

# 10 Best Public Domain Image Websites

![author avatar](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg)

##### Liza Brown

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

## What Are Public Domain Images?

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

## How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?

 A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images.

 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

## What Are Public Domain Images?

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

## How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?

 A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

## What Are Public Domain Images?

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

## How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?

 A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.

## Best Websites for Downloading Public Domain Images

 We’ve searched the Internet and we utilized our results to compile a collection of the most reliable websites that grant its users access to vast numbers of public domain images. Let’s take a look at some of the best websites that let you download public domain images.

 Graphic designers and all other creatives in constant need of a fresh supply of public domain images don’t need a special introduction to Pexels. The stock image platform is dedicated to photography and video, so you can’t use it to search for vectors or clip art. Even so, you can use Pexles to search for public domain images based on a particular keyword or browse through its collection of free images and discover photos spontaneously. Clicking on the Popular Searches tab will enable you to see the images from Light, Nature or Animals and it will shorten the amount of time you have to spend looking for a photo you want to download.

Alternatively, you can insert a keyword into a search bar and Unsplash will show you the results within seconds.

That’s why you must click on the Free Photos tab before you start searching for public domain images on this website. The website hosts nearly 400.000 photos, videos, and vector graphics, but you must make sure that a file you want to download is within the public domain before you download it.

**Pros:**

* Creating an account on Morguefile is free

**Cons:**

![mp4 format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/solution-for-choosing-fast-youtube-to-mp4-video-converter-02.jpg)

MP4 files were executed under the ISO/IEC 14496-12:2001 standard by the IEC/ISO and Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG). MP4 is an international specification for audio-visual coding only because of this.

### 02**Pros and Cons of the MP4 format**

**Pros of the MP4 format**

One of the critical merits of the MP4 format is that it can be valuable on different platforms.

**Cons of the MP4 format**

Note that the format is a container. This means that instead of storing the ode for the file, it keeps the data. Moreover, a specific MP4 file is based upon particular codecs because it does not have a native way of managing the involved coding.

A possible drawback is that there are hundreds of codecs available. Therefore, a media player must run a set of codecs concerning a particular MP4 file.

Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.

**●** Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.

**●** Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.

**●** It is still a lossy format. A higher compression format and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality losses.

**●** The familiarity of the MP4 format, coupled with its portability, has also enabled the illegal distribution of copyrighted audio-video files.

### 03**Is it possible to convert videos to MP4 without any software?**
