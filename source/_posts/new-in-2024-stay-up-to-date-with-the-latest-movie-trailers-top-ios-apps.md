The staggering amounts of video content on the Internet are making it difficult to attract the attention of the audience you are targeting. Summarizing the highlights of your video in a short twenty to thirty-second trailer is one of the techniques you can use to spark the audience’s attention and ultimately increase the number of views your videos are getting.

Besides the promotional purposes, you can also use trailers to create entertaining short videos in order to have fun with your friends. Fortunately, you don’t need a [professional video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) suite to perform this task since there are hundreds of [video editing apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allow you **to create trailers on iPhones and iPads.**

So, in this article we are going to take you through the top ten movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads you can use to create eye-catching trailers for all types of videos you create.

## Top 10 Movie Trailer Apps for iPhones and iPads

Selecting the footage you are going to include in the trailer you are making, is probably the most difficult part of the process, since most movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads offer customizable templates. In addition, the music you choose as the soundtrack for your trailer needs to match with the visuals and the editing style you opted for. Let’s take a look at the top 10 movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Price:** Free

All iPhones and iPads offer a free way to edit all videos you record with them. All you need to do is make sure that iMovie is installed on your iPhone or iPad and you can start editing the footage you recorded. In addition, you can also import videos recorded with different types of cameras into iMovie, as long as they are saved in the file format that is compatible with this app.

iMovie offers a variety of predesigned trailer themes, so you just have to pick the one you like the most and then choose the footage you want to include in your trailer. Keep in mind that you cannot add music to any of the trailer themes, but you can export the trailer you created and create the soundtrack from iMovie’s Video mode. What’s more, you can also use this app to [add transitions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), visual effects or [titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to the trailers you create with iMovie.
