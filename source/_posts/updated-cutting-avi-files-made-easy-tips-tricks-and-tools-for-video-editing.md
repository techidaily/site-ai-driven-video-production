**Tip 2:** Make sure there is enough space for shooting time-lapse video. Large capacity memory cards are always welcomed.

**Tip 3:**  Charge the battery fully before shooting and prepare a standby battery if you have.

If you wanna make a time lapse video with photos, you need set up your camera to take photos at a proper interval, such as take photo at every five second or use the built-in time lapse shooting settings in your camera. It is recommended to record or take photos for at least 20 minutes because the time lapse video will speed up. OK, now let’s start making the time lapse video:

## Method 1: Creating time lapse video from photos

#### 1  Import the original photos to Filmora

After installing and launch Filmora video editor, import the shot time lapse photos to it. Click **New Project** and then click the **Import** button to add your photos to the media library.

You can also import the photos from the video shooting device. Just plug in the video camera, click **Import from Phone or Camera** option in Import menu, and then transfer the target media files to Filmora.

After that, you need to select and drag and drop all the photos to the first video track.

#### 2 Preview the photos

After all your photos are placed in timeline, you can zoom in the timeline or preview it in the Preview window to check if it needs any order adjustment or deletion.

#### 3 Adjust Photo Duration to Create Time lapse Video

Select one of the photos in the timeline and right click on it to select **Speed and Duration** to open the Custom Speed panel. Go to **Duration** section, and change the duration of the photo to 00:00:00:01 or other duration based on your needs, and then click **OK**.

If everything works fine, click the **Export** tab and choose the target format and click **SETTINGS** to output the time lapse video.

## Method 2: Speed Up to Make a Time lapse Video

In case that you want to make a time lapse video with video footage, below are the step-by-step tutorial:

#### 1 Import Video Footage

#### 2 Cut out part of the video for time lapse editing (optional)

#### 3 Speed up to create time lapse video

Right click on the video clip in the timeline to select **Speed and Duration**. Then a window will pop up for you to adjust the settings of video. Find the **Speed** option and drag the slider bar to the right to increase the speed.
