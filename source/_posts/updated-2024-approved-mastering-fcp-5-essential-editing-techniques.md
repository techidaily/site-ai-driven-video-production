## Top 5 Final Cut Pro editing tips

The major criteria that differentiate simple editing tools and Final Cut Pro is the speed as in FCP users are able to stream knowledge into tricks within a few minutes. Things that make FCP one of the best tools for video editing needs are discussed as below:

#### 1.Favourites and Keyword first

With FCP, it is possible to add keywords to your videos in much easier manner. Users simply need to press Command K for bringing up required keywords on timeline. The predefined keywords of your media file are also organized with control shortcuts. You can go to favourites option from drop down menu directly and the clips can be shorted as well as organized with easy-to-use collections on the left side.

#### 2.Custom Keyboard shortcuts for hidden features

Keyboard shortcuts can provide faster support to some common actions and this feature is well equipped in FCP. For example, it is possible to use H and G as shortcut commands to initiate the action of Trim End and Trim Start. You will be glad to know that FCP allows customization for shortcuts that means you can add something more than the default keys as per need. Simple go to Final Cut Pro and then visit Commands; here you need to click on Customize and soon you will be able to assign different keys for required tasks.

#### 3.Live Trimming

When we start editing any media clip then one of our major needs is to make that clip shorter but not all available software tools assists in easy trimming. Users of FCP are blessed in this context as they can trim videos on real time basis by using Trim Start, Trim End and Trim Playhead facility.

#### 4.Adjustment Layers
