Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.

Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.
