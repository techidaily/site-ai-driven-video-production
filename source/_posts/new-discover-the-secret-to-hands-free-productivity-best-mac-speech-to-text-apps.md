![top 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-1.jpg)

Did you know your Mac device comes with a built-in speech-to-text feature? So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device's microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.

The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.

Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.

Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:

1. Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select **System Preferences** from the resulting menu.
2. Click on the **Keyboard** option from the system preferences screen.
3. Once there, click on the **Dictation** option located at the top of the menu.
4. Select **On** to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the **Use Enhanced Dictation** box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.
5. Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.

Please note that you need to speak your punctuation loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.

Google Docs is arguably the market's most accurate free speech-to-text service. In addition, it allows you to transcribe your voice to text and format documents with your voice. However, you can only use the service through the Chrome browser.

You don’t have to be a music prodigy to create an amazing music video, you don’t even have to know how to sing, because there are hundreds of iOS and Android-based apps that let you create a lip sync video. The only important thing is to move your lips and appear to be saying the same words at the exact same moment as the real singer of the song you’re covering. **Lip syncing** allows you to focus on your dancing or any other action you’re planning on doing in a video and reduces the need to perform a song perfectly.

**Lip sync videos** are a great source of fun, and producing them doesn’t require you to have a professional video or sound equipment. In this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the **best lip sync apps on iPhone and Android phones**, and we are going to show you **how to use them to create amazing lip sync videos**.

## Making Lip Sync Videos with 5 Best Lip Sync Apps

Lip syncing seems easier than it actually is because synchronizing the movement of your lips with the lyrics of a song can prove to be a challenging task. If the first take doesn’t turn out the way you wanted, keep trying because the practice is one of the most important aspects of creating a great lip sync video.

#### 1. TikTok

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/ro/app/tiktok/id835599320?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.android.ugc.trill&hl=en%5FUS)

In a little over two years, TikTok has become one of the largest platforms for music videos in the world after the acquisition of Musical.ly. Currently, the app **has over 150 million daily users** and the TikTok community keeps growing at an astounding rate. You can **browse through the latest videos** on the platform or **upload your own videos**.

The **+** icon located near the bottom of the screen grants you access to the **video recording** options. To access the TikTok’s library of songs you just have to tap on the **Pick a Sound** option and select the song you want to use in your video. As you tap on a song, a **Shoot with this sound** option will appear on the screen, tap on it to begin recording a video. The **scissors icon** can be used to **set the start and end points of a song**, while the menu near the bottom of the screen lets you choose **how fast the playback** of the song is going to be. Hit the **Record** button to start making your new lip sync video and once the recording session is over hit the **Post** icon to share the video on the TikTok platform.

#### 2. Triller

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.triller.droid&hl=en)

Recording a video with this app is easy since you just have to choose a song, set its duration, and hit the record button. The duration of all songs in the Triller’s music library is limited to just 30 seconds, and if you want to make a longer lip sync video, you have to upload a song from your device.

Tapping the Capture button will start the video recording session and while you’re recording you can zoom in or zoom out in order to change the composition of the shot. The app’s auto editing algorithm will render the video after you stop recording, but you can still add emojis, stickers or filters to each lip sync video you create with this app, by selecting the Re Edit option. The videos you produce with this app can be shared on all of the most popular social media or on the Triller platform

#### 3. [Dubsmash](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dubsmash-lip-sync-dance/id918820076?mt=8)

After you’ve captured a lip sync video you can add text effects, apply filters or stickers to make it even more amusing.
