There are so many situations in our life when we wish to go back in past and change things for better scope; sadly, life does not provide that option in real. But there is an option to rewind or reverse things in the world of video editing as here one can easily make time fly backward and view things for fun. Before you start using the skills and tools for editing videos to create such a beautiful effect, it is good to go through few important terms.

#### **Difference between Rewind and Reverse:**

#### **Reverse:**

The word reverse as the name reflects, means that we can play a video from its end towards the initial position. Yes, it is possible to reverse the order of video frames in order to arrange them in such a way that last frame appears first following the reverse sequence so that first frame goes to the last position in the clip.

#### **Rewind:**

On the other side rewind is also an interesting feature for video editing where users simply duplicate the clip in form of a segment or make adjustments over range selection and then rewind that particular segment at a speed many times faster than the original speed of clip. After this they play segment of original clip in normal speed towards forward direction.

Although it is possible to get the rewind effect in videos with simple reverse option but still Apple platform supports both of these as standalone options.

## How to reverse a clip in Final Cut Pro

You might have heard about Retiming effect in videos where we either speed up our clip or slow it down by certain time factor so that a desired effect can be achieved. There are two types of retiming effects: Variable speed type and constant speed format. FCP is capable enough to merge the reverse option with retiming effects so that something innovative can be developed even with simple editing efforts.

#### **Step 1:**

First of all go to timeline and then select the desired clip from your collection that you want to reverse. It is also possible to apply this effect on a group of clips as per need.

#### **Step 2:**

Now you need to go to the pop up menu where an option for reverse the clip is available in form of an arrow pointing towards left direction.

Hit that reverse option.

#### **Step 3:**

In case if you want to customize speed of reversed clip then use retiming handle and drag it to right or left as per need of decreasing or increasing the clip speed.
