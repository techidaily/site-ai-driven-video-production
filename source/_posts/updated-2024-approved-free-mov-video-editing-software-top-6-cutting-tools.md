PC owners who often upload video content to their social media accounts or run a YouTube channel can **easily compress their footage on Windows 10**. There are a number of options that enable you to reduce the size of a video on the latest version of the Windows OS, but which one you are going to choose depends on a number of factors that range from your preferred method of reducing a video file’s size to how fast the compression process is.

In this article, we are going to take you through **nine best free video compressors for Windows 10** and help you discover the one you feel comfortable using.

### 1.[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \- \[Free trial and Paid subscription\]

### 2.[Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

The Windows 10’s native Photos App offers a broad spectrum of photo and video editing tools that can be used even by novice photo and video editors. Besides the **standard photo editing features** that enable you to enhance your photos in just a few clicks, the [Photos App also lets you **trim**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, merge or add text overlays and filters to your videos.**

In order to compress a video file with the Photos App, you need to create a new project by clicking on the **New Video** drop-down menu and selecting the **New Video Project** option. You can then import the video clips you want to compress to the project you created and perform all other video editing tasks you want.

![Windows 10 Save

video in small size ](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows10-photos-app-compress-video-size.jpg>)

When done, you should click on the **Finish** **video** **button** and choose from **Small, Medium or Large** output video size before you start the video exporting. The only downside is that you **cannot choose the file format of the video you’re exporting from the Photos App.** Even so, you can compress MP4 videos to a smaller size with the Photos App for free, which makes it useful if you want to quickly compress a video before sharing it on social media.

### 3.[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

This is probably one of the **[best open-source media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**ever created because it supports all video file formats. Besides video playback capabilities, VLC also offers a number of video editing features that can help you remove unwanted parts of video clips or apply filters and effects. There are three different ways to compress a video in VLC.

You can either convert a file **by changing its output file format, adjusting the bitrate and the frame rate** or by cropping and recording segments of the video clip you want to compress.

The fastest and easiest way to reduce a video’s size in VCL is to change its file format. You can do this by clicking on the **Convert/Save option** in the **Media menu**. You can then select one of the available profile presets from the **Profile drop-down menu** and select the option that is best suited for the context in which the video is going to be used. Optionally, you can click on the **Settings icon** next to the Profile drop-down menu in case you would like to adjust a video’s resolution manually.

### 4.[Freemake Video Converter](https://www.freemake.com/free%5Fvideo%5Fconverter/)

Freemake Video Converter is compatible with all versions of the Windows OS that were released since 2006, which makes it one of the **best free video compressors** for Windows 10\. It supports more than **five hundred video file formats**, and it lets you turn photos and audio files into videos.

![Freemake video
