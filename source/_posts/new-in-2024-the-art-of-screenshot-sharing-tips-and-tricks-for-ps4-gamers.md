 You can now easily capture screenshots on your PS4 with the inclusion of the new _SHARE_ button on the DualShock 4 controller. This can be done either through the short or long press settings configured for your _SHARE_ button. Kindly follow me through the different options that you have on how you can capture and share your PS4 screenshots; **Option 1: Through the SHARE button** or; **Option 2: On A Separate Platform**.

## Capture screenshots on PS4 with SHARE button

 You can’t miss the _SHARE_ button on the new controller for the latest PS4\. It’s sitting on the left-hand side of the touch pad (as shown in the screenshot below). A short press on _SHARE_ button (by default) will take you into the Share’s interface. In order to capture a screen shot, you’ll need to perform a long press. Alternatively, change your _Share Settings_ to _Easy Screenshots_ where the press works in contrary of the defaulted settings.

### 1 Upload Screenshots

 Go back to the Share’s interface and select _Upload Screenshot_. Simply browse through the screenshot that you’ll like to share or upload and then click once to select it. You can also hit _Options_ instead to preview the details of the screenshot before.

### 2 Share to Facebook or Twitter

 You can choose to share your screenshots online through Facebook or Twitter. Please take note that you will have to log-in to your Facebook or Twitter account prior to uploading your screenshots and be prompted with a message to give your permission. You’ll only have to go through this once.

## Use third party software for screenshot sharing

 You can also share your PS4 captured screenshots on a separate platform such as the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can easily drag-and-drop your screenshots on the interface, stitch, personalize with effects and even insert your favorite track as the background music.

 Other than that, you can also convert your screenshots to a file format that’s compatible with your portable device; uploading onto YouTube (with additional options to share on Twitter as well as Facebook); burn your own DVD and much more. Download the trial version and try it out right now.
