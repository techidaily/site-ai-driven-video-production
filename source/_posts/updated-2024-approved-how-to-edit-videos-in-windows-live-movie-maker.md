So what would you do then? Have no direction to edit video on Mac OS X 10.10?

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Don’t worry. Here a comprehensive and easy-to-use video editor for Yosemite – Wondershare [Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is recommended.

Creating a great soundtrack with Music Video Maker is simple because you can just select a song and cut or trim the parts you don't want to use in the video. The app's video editor lets you apply effects, add frames and text overlays, while you can also import as many as sixty photos from your camera roll and turn them into an HD video.

However, the Music Video Maker is primarily a photo editor, which means that it lacks some of the frequently used effects that are commonly used in music videos that are posted on TikTok and other similar platforms. The app contains ads, which can slow you down during the video editing process. Despite all of these downsides, Music Video Maker app still offers powerful tools that enable its users to create music videos quickly.

#### 7. Fideo Music Video Show

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.zentertain.funvideo&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

The app's user-friendly interface makes it easy to create and discover music videos. Downloading Fideo Music Video Show will make you a part of the global community of music video makers, so you can become friends with like-minded people and follow their work. The process of making a music video with Fideo is straightforward since you only have to select a song from the app's music library that contains thousands of sounds and songs and record the lip-sync video. The video editing features enable you to polish your videos in any way you want and share it with other Fideo users to get likes and comments.

Even though the app offers a decent amount of video editing options, it lacks the cool visual effects, apps like TikTok Including Musical.ly or Video Star offer. What's more, Fideo's file sharing options are limited as you can't share your videos on other social media networks.

#### 8. Video Maker with Music Editor

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-maker-with-music-editor/id1006386292?mt=8)

**Price:**  Free, contains in-app purchases

Choose from Free, Cinematic or Pop music categories, among others and start creating your own music video. This iOS-based app lets you choose the video clip from a camera roll and edit it using its powerful tools. Video Maker with Music Editor also lets you record your own voice or use sounds and songs from your music library.

You can add as many music tracks to your videos as you want, which means that you can combine two or more songs in a single clip. The app also features the fade-in and fade-out effect, so you can make smooth transitions between two songs. Sharing your favorite videos to Instagram or Facebook directly from Video Maker with Music Editor app, is easy, while you can also save your videos to your camera roll. The free version of the app contains only the basic music and video editing options, and in order to gain access to all features, you must select one of the available subscription plans.

**Conclusion**

Choosing a video maker app is much easier if you know what type of videos you want to produce. If you want to make short music videos lip-syncing features or the size of the music library the app offers should play a large role in your decision, while video editing tools should be your first priority if in addition to music videos you also plan to make vlogs or fashion videos. What is your favorite app for editing music videos? Leave a comment and let us know.
