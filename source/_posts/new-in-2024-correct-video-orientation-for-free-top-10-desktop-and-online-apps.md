> * [Part 2: What stabilizer can be adopted in the final cut pro?](#part2)
> * [Part 3: How to stabilize your footage with easier steps?](#part3)
> * [Part 4: Extensive reading: How to shoot a stabilized video in the first place?](#part4)

## **Part 1: How to stabilize your footage via final cut pro?**

The Final Cut Pro tool is exclusively designed to edit the videos professionally. The built-in features of this program are incredible and it works optimally with different video types. You can alter every detail in the video footage using the functionalities of Final Cut Pro. It is easy to import and export video files irrespective of their length. This app helps you to fix issues in the video footage that cannot be modified during the shoot time. The unexpected interruptions in the videos can be sorted out using the Final Cut Pro tool.

The stabilization feature helps to fix the shaky videos precisely. The Final Cut Pro application enables you to implement this feature in your footage easily. It is enough if you click the right controls to enable this option. This functionality is available to work on the shaky clipping on the video to acquire the desired results. To stabilize the shaky video with the Final Cut Pro app, you can follow the below instructions.

Step 1 You must import your video footage into the Final Cut Pro environment and add them to the working timeline.

Use the **add -> media file** option to include the video file into the Final Cut Pro ambience. Then, launch the ‘Video Inspector’ option.

Step 2 Enable the Stabilization check box to turn on this feature on the imported video.

In this module, you can find options to choose to fine-tune the stabilization attributes.

By default, the stabilization method is assigned to "**Automatic**". This function modifies the stabilizing factors on the shaky clippings. You can modify this method by dragging the sliders below.

There are two more methods available namely inertia Cam and Smooth Cam. In the Inertia Cam, you can work on the zoom options of the videos. The Smooth Cam allows you to perform translation, rotation, and alter the scale parameters to overcome the flaws in the videos.

You can set these parameters by dragging the points on the value sliders simultaneously when you play the videos. Fix the point on the slider, if you feel the shaky parameters are restored to normal position. Use this method to resolve the shaky videos effectively.

You can set the stabilization parameters by the trial-and-error method. Depending on the intensity of interruptions on the video footage, you need to fix a perfect value for each slider namely Translation, Rotation, and scale. Randomly move the pointers on the sliders and identify the best combination to overcome the distortion in the recorded video.
