The features list of videopad video editor is as follows:

### **Ease of use and interface**

With VideoPad's easy-to-use interface and well-organized conventions, movie makers of any skill level can become familiar with its basics in no time at all. You will become fluent in no time at all in opening and closing windows, stringing clips together, and adding narration, transitions, and text to create a powerful visual presentation. Adding video, audio, and still, photo assets to the files pane will put them on the timeline and allow you to assemble your story.

Videos and still images are organized into bins by the app, ensuring they don't get confused on the timeline, which speeds up the workflow, especially for newcomers.

The app uses menus and can be dragged and dropped, so a single objective can be accomplished in different ways. You can control all functions from within the application frame, or dockable panels can be used to get a closer look at what needs to be done. A permanent reorganization of the workspace would be appreciated.

### **Videopad Video Editing Features**

VideoPad is the perfect balance between too much and not enough. Although there are not many options, it offers a reasonable selection of transitions for moving between clips and images, as well as a selection of filters to give them a unique look. In addition to editing 360-degree video, video stabilization is another helpful feature.

Each filter can be previewed with a click before applying it, and You can combine several to create a custom effect or template for reuse. You can also adjust their length via menus.

A video can be enhanced with transitions, visual effects, overlays, and text using VideoPad. Also included are some basic audio tools and a library of sound effects and atmospheric background music. There are a number of features that allow you to optimize videos, including color correction, adding digital images, adding subtitles, and adjusting the speed of playback. With its video stabilization feature, you can reduce camera shake, and the high-end version supports special effect plugins, but only for Windows.

### **Videopad Audio Editing Features**

VideoPad offers a limited set of audio tools, but it does allow you to mix multiple audio tracks, music, and narration to create a movie soundtrack. A video clip's audio can be faded, mixed, and adjusted for volume, but if you want to go further, you'll need an external mixer or editor. From VideoPad's main menu, you can download NCH's own WavePad.

While the text-to-speech features always sounded false, you can record narration directly within the program. There is a great idea in having voice recognition for subtitles, which is only available on the Windows version. However, the implementation falls short of expectations. Although the video was clearly spoken in a quiet environment, it automatically failed to translate into subtitles.

### **Videopad Content Sharing features**

Video creators who publish to YouTube or other social media platforms can use the software because it allows them to share videos directly to platforms such as Dropbox, Flickr, Google Drive, and Vimeo. To avoid unnecessary data sharing, you can save videos to your desktop and upload them yourself.

### **Is VideoPad worth buying?**

Although the VideoPad video editor free version is somewhat limited, it functions as a free trial to see if you like it enough to upgrade. Apps that are easy to use and have a simple interface can help convert a free user to a paying customer, and VideoPad has a strong claim to your money thanks to its simplicity and light hardware requirements.

## **Our Recommendation**

As a beginner, you may be looking to use Videopad free, but when it comes to features, it just falls short compared to modern video editors. So, we recommend you use our Filmora X video editor. Filmora video editor is free to download, so you can try out all the features without paying a penny. However free version will have a watermark when you export the video. You will have to purchase a subscription to get rid of the watermark. If you compare the features and user-friendliness of both these video editors, then Filmora definitely stands out by all means. In addition to its feature richness, it also has a user-friendly interface that beginners can easily adapt to. So, don't waste your time and give it a try right now.
