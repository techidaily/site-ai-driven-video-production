You can add your favorite music or audio effects and text to your video slideshow with FCP. A variety of jingles and sound effects are available in Final Cut Pro that can be used in your video slideshow for free. If the build-in sound effects do not seem interesting, record your own audio and create your audio effects. FCP also allows users to import music files from their computers and add them to video slideshows.

To add music, click File > Import > Files. Now, either select the music file to be added from the FCP library or your computer and click Import. Finally, drag the imported file to the Timeline. It will be added to your video slideshow.

To add text, go to the Browser window, select Effects, click Video Generators, and double-click Text and Text again. Now, click Controls and enter the text you want to add to your video slideshow. Finally, click Video and drag your video box with the text into the desired location in the Final Cut Pro Timeline.
