**Step 3: Add Additional Decorations (Optional)**

Use the tools available in the toolbox on the left to add other elements like text, stock video clips, images, audio, etc. to make the footage look more professional and appealing.

**Step 4: Export and Download the Video**

Once everything is done, click the **Play** button above the Timeline to preview the clip, and once found acceptable, click **Export Video** from the top-right area to export the footage.

On the next page, click Download from the right to download the slow-motion video to your local hard drive. Alternatively, you can also click the down icon that is present next to the **Export Video** button, and choose your preferred format from the menu to export the video.

## Part 2: FAQs About Kapwing Online Video Editor

**1\. Is Kapwing really free?**

Yes, it is free, and there will be no watermark on videos under 5 minutes. However, upon exporting, the videos remain available for the public which could be a breach of privacy for some users. This limitation can be removed by subscribing to the web tool’s paid membership. You can choose either a $192 per year or $24 per month plan for the subscription.

**2\. What is the limitation of using the Kapwing free plan?**

When you use Kapwing with the free plan:

* All the videos that you produce remain available for the public viewing;
* The video files that you upload cannot exceed 250MB in size;
* Export 3 hours of video per month, and each video is limited to 30 minutes long;
* The resolution of the videos is restricted to 720p only, etc.

**3\. How slow can I make it with Kapwing?**

You can slow down the playback speed to 0.25x with Kapwing. When increasing the speed, it can go up to 4x.

**Conclusion**

Kapwing is an efficient online video editor. The best part is, the tool doesn’t add a watermark to the videos even if you are using its free plan. However, certain restrictions like file size limit, resolution threshold, etc. are imposed on you if you are a non-paid user. To get rid of all such barriers, you must subscribe to a monthly or annual plan that is $24 or $192 respectively.
