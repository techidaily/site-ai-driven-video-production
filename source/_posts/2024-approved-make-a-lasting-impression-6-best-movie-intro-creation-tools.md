[TikTok](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok-make-your-day/id835599320) is a Chinese video-making and sharing social networking application used to create short dances, lip syncs, comedy and talent recordings, and much more. The introduction of the reaction feature in Tiktok enables the users to make and share their opinions about a particular event without leaving the application, therefore attracting more users even from other social media platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.

To record a reaction, you can begin playing the video, tap the **Share** icon to open the menu and tap the **React** option.

**Pros**

* TikTok is free to use

Although not particularly a reaction video maker app, iMovie can be used to create plenty of them by recording your footage on your smartphone, downloading the source videos from TikTok, transferring both the clips to your Mac computer with iMovie installed (or installing iMovie on your iOS device if you are OK comfortable with the version), doing some basic editing tasks, downloading and importing the pre-keyed effects, adding them to your reaction project, and then exporting the final reaction in your preferred format.

### 1\.  TikTok

**Available for:** Android, iOS, iPad

[TikTok](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok-make-your-day/id835599320) is a Chinese video-making and sharing social networking application used to create short dances, lip syncs, comedy and talent recordings, and much more. The introduction of the reaction feature in Tiktok enables the users to make and share their opinions about a particular event without leaving the application, therefore attracting more users even from other social media platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.

To record a reaction, you can begin playing the video, tap the **Share** icon to open the menu and tap the **React** option. With this, Tiktok presents you with a video creation screen that allows you to add audio, change the position of the reaction box, and then record a video using your smartphone’s rear or front camera.

The software is available for both Mac computers and iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad and has almost all the features and functions required to edit and manipulate the videos to bring the best out of them.

Although not particularly a reaction video maker app, iMovie can be used to create plenty of them by recording your footage on your smartphone, downloading the source videos from TikTok, transferring both the clips to your Mac computer with iMovie installed (or installing iMovie on your iOS device if you are OK comfortable with the version), doing some basic editing tasks, downloading and importing the pre-keyed effects, adding them to your reaction project, and then exporting the final reaction in your preferred format.

**Pros**

With iReact, you can record intros as well where the app lets you capture self-introduction before the actual clip. This structure is widely popular among the YouTube community.

As an added advantage, options like replay, pause, resume, rewind, and [fast-forward](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) come in handy as you can perform all these tasks while the camera records your reaction.

Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.
