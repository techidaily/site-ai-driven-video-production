### 4\. Massless

**Website:** [https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai](https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai/)

Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.

You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:

* Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., **Nose**).
* Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., **Nose**), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.
* Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.
* Click **Download images** from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.

You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.
