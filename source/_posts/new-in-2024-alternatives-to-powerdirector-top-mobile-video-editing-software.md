Video editing was once exclusively the realm of the PC, but with the power of modern smartphones and tablets even professionals are more frequently editing on the go. This should come as no surprise as most of our photos and footage are stored on mobile devices, while apps like PowerDirector give the full functionality of a professional editing suite on mobile technology.

Currently PowerDirector is only available on Android, but if you’re using an iOS device you’re sadly missing out. Luckily there are several alternative apps that allow you to edit your footage from a mobile device; see our reviews below.

## Best PowerDirector Alternatives for Android and iOS

#### 1\. [Kinemaster](https://www.kinemaster.com/index.php?lang=en) \- £2.91 per month

System: Android, iOS

Kinemaster is an impressive app that brings simplicity to complex professional editing tools, making it easy to use even on a small screen. It supports multiple layers including unlimited text, handwriting and sticker layers, as well as up to two video layers and four additional audio tracks. The precision editing features allow you edit frame by frame and it’s easy to quickly import extra footage and add additional effects. With a host of other features we haven’t mentioned it’s amazing how simple this app is. The only downside is the pricing model; instead of a one-off payment you’re saddled with £2.91 per month, an investment that could end up exceeding the value of the app.

#### 2\. [LumaFX](https://luma-touch.com/lumafx/) \- £2.99

System: iOS

LumaFX is a treasure trove of editing effects and goodies, allowing you to completely change the look of your video. The colour and FX sections of the app have a variety of filters and presets that allow you to do anything from fixing annoying colours to transforming your video into a psychedelic cartoon. The versatility of crop tools is also incredibly impressive, allowing you to crop your clip to different aspect ratios that can then be can be flipped and rotated, slowed down, reversed, and trimmed. Even if you decide on another more powerful editing app, the low cost and range of features of LumaFX makes it ideal for using in conjunction with your app of choice to produce the ultimate video content.

#### 3\. iMovie – Free

System: iOS

Every iOS user should be familiar with iMovie as it comes bundled on every apple device. Costing nothing is a big upside, especially when the technology handles as intuitively as it does. Splicing footage becomes laughably easy. On the audio side you can add music and personalised voiceovers to your videos and if you’re in the mood for something a little silly there are plenty of over the top TV templates and movie style themes. Accessibility is a big plus for iMovie, but it’s definitely geared to more casual users – professionals will find high end features lacking and should consider a more powerful paid alternative.

#### 4\. [Adobe Premiere Clip](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-clip.html) \- Free

System: Android, iOS

Another free offering, Adobe Premiere Clip shares many of both the benefits and flaws of iMovie. For the casual user its ideal, offering a straightforward means of arranging clips that’s predominantly designed for speed. The creative cloud allows you to continue editing on the desktop Premiere Pro making it a handy extension for existing Adobe customers. It’s also a much more compact download than iMovie; 91 MB compared to 600\. There’s a standard array of editing features including trimming and a basic title editor, as well as the option to export options to social sharing sites of your choice, but unless you already work within the creative cloud there’s limited reasons to choose this over the superior iMovie.

There really is no beating PowerDirector for Android, but iOS users should be able to find an app or combination of apps to allow them to continue editing on the move.

As Final Cut Pro X comes overloaded with advanced, powerful tools, you can find it a little tricky. Hence, we are here to help you perform **the Final Cut Pro L-Cuts** in this session. And, yes, the **Final Cut Pro J-Cuts** as well.

**Step 1: Import media files**

Once you launch Final Cut Pro X on your Mac device, create a new project by tapping project under the new section of the “File” menu.

You can now import the video file to the workspace by executing “File > Export > Media” or by tapping the “Import Media” option on the welcome screen.

**Step 2: Expand audio in video**

Now, drag the videos to the timeline in the respective order, and expand or detach the video's audio on the timeline for easy or precise working.

**Step 3: Drag the second video to the left**

To create the Final Cut Pro L-Cuts, make sure that the first clip's edit point or audio fades out at the end.

Finally, drag the second clip's edit point to the left so that the video gets the audio of the first video.

L-Cuts are now in Final Cut Pro X.

**Note:** Here, the L-Cuts added video clip has no audio and has related well enough to the first video clip. If the second video has audio, it must be detached first, and then you should drag the edit point.

**Step 4: Final Cut Pro J-Cuts**

In the case of Final Cut Pro **J-Cuts**, the process is reverse, where you need to detach the audio of the preceding or following video clip and drag the first video to the right.

When you look at the transition closely, you can see that it resembles the letter J.

## Part 3: Final Cut Pro X Keyboard Shortcuts for L-Cuts and J-Cuts

Final Cut Pro X offers specific keyword shorts to perform Final Cut Pro L-Cuts and Final Cut Pro J-Cuts.

1\. As the first step, trim the clips shorter to get the media handles. To detach audio from the video clip, you need to press “Ctrl + S” which will expand the audio.

2\. Now, move or place the playhead at the endpoint of both the video clips where here are the keyboard shortcuts:

* To shift the playhead to the earlier edit point: press “**Semicolon (;) or up arrow key**”.
* To move the playhead to the next edit point: press “**Apostrophe (‘) or down arrow key**”.

3\. To choose the audio or the video edit point, you can do one of the following:

* Press “**Shift-Backslash (\\)**” to select both sides of the audio endpoint.
* Press “**Backslash (\\)**” to pick both sides of the video endpoint.

4\. Here is the actual process or the keyboard shortcut that helps accomplish final **cut pro-L-cuts** or **final cut pro-J-cuts** by nudging the edit points.

* To nudge or push the edit point to the left or right: press “**Comma (,) or period (.)**”.
* To move the edit point to the left or right with ten frames: press “**Shift-Comma (,) or Sift-Period (.)**”.
* Using timecode to add or subtract the present edit: press the “**Plus (+)**” or “**Minus (-)**” key with the timecode duration.

## Conclusion

Are you wondering and puzzled that you are a popular Final Cut Pro X user but weren't aware of this powerful split edit tool till now? It isn't too late for you to start yet. Finally, as assured at the beginning of the article, we gave you detailed information on what are J-Cuts in Final Cut Pro along with L-Cuts. With practical implementation on creating Final Cut Pro L-Cuts and J-Cuts, all the best for your first video project!

If you wish to edit or create videos like a pro, you do not need to be a professional. Instead, be creative, learn new things, and think out of the box. You could draw inspiration from videos and films for their great clips and animations. If you are already familiar with video making, you would know basic editing tasks like trim, crop, transitions, filters, and so on. Ever knew the term **J-Cuts**, and **L-Cuts**?

It could be surprising, but yes, your well-known Final Cut Pro X has this powerful feature still overlooked by many people. So, today, we take it on hand and shall share what L-Cuts and J-Cuts mean. You will be able to create it on your own by the end of this article.

## Part 1: The Use of L-Cuts and J-Cuts in Video Editing

Ordinary images, text, subtitles, and GIF doesn’t work anymore to get followers or likes on a video on YouTube channel or Instagram. Thus, video creators are tired of trying the same filters, transitions on the video editor tool. To create amazing videos like the ones played on your television and favorite movies, all you need is the split edit type techniques, a powerful editing tool used by professional editors. Although called professional, it isn’t difficult for a beginner if you know J-Cuts and L-Cuts.

They are nothing but the transition between the video and audio at different times and are entirely separate from wipes and fades. Such video editing technique helps in maintaining visual continuity. These super basic cuts are a combination of dialogue and imagery, thus keeping the video flow without a monotonous feeling.

When you look at the above interface, you will see the basic phenomenon behind the two split cuts. In L-Cuts, although the first video ends, the audio continues to clip two as well.

Then, **what is a J cut in Final Cut Pro**? It is ultimately reverse or opposite of L-Cuts. Yes, the second clip's audio starts a while before the scene of the first video ends.

## Streamline Your Workflow: Top Adobe Premiere Shortcuts You Need

# Top 20 Adobe Premiere Shortcuts You Will Use When Editing Video Files

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Whilst the conventional mouse control allows you to perform any task that Premiere is capable of, for efficient workflow the keyboard shortcuts cannot be beaten. We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and [Final Cut Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.

---

 This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

---

 This is achieved by going through the path edit > keyboard shortcuts as below:

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shortcut-1.jpg)

 Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I'm sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I'll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.

#### 1Select Window

 I'm starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.

* Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9
* Audio Track Mixer Shift+6
* Effect Controls Shift+5
* Effects Shift+7
* Media Browser Shift+8
* Program Monitor Shift+4
* Project Shift+1
* Source Monitor Shift+2
* Timelines Shift+3

#### 2 Import

 Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-3.png)

#### 3Capture Panel

 There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.

* Navigate Through Fields - Tab
* Cancel Capture - Esc
* Fast Forward - F
* Rewind - R
* Go to In Point - Q
* Go to Out Point - W
* Record - G
* Stop - S
* Step Back - Left Arrow
* Step Forward - Right Arrow

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-2.jpg)

#### 4 Timeline Panel

 In a similar vein to the Capture Panel, the Timeline Panel has a set of shortcuts specific to all its basic operations, and are essential for a faster workflow.

* Clear Ins and Outs - G
* Clear In Point - D
* Clear Out Point - F
* Go to In Point- Q
* Go to Out Point - W
* Match Frame - M
* Start and Stop - Spacebar
* Play Normal Speed - L
* Play Reverse Normal Speed - J
* Set In Point - I
* Set Out Point - o
* Shuttle Stop - K
* Trim - T
* Arc Tool - A
* Ellipse Tool – E

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-4.jpg)

#### 5 Navigation within a clip

 This one works within the program monitor/timeline or source monitor windows, ensure the desired one is active first of course. You can move to a specific time code within the clip, or go forwards or backwards a set number of frames using the number pad. To go to a specific time code simply type that on the number pad. To travel a set number of frames simply type + or – (to signify direction) and the number of frames.

#### 6Marking Clips

 By far the simplest way to mark clips is to use the keyboard shortcut.

 For marking clips use X , whilst marking a selection is / .

#### 7 In and Out

 In addition to marking clips via shortcuts, it is also far easier to mark In and Out points this way.

* To Mark In use I , whilst to mark Out use O .
* To Clear In the shortcut is Control+Shift+I for PC and Option+I for Mac.
* To Clear Out Control+Shift+O for PC, Option+O for Mac.

#### 8Playing Clips

 Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:

* Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac
* Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac
* Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.

 To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit > preferences > playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-5.jpg)

 In addition, turning on looping for this can help to fine tune edits.

#### 9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing

 There are times you may want to hear audio when scrubbing, however turning it off can have beneficial effects on performance for lower end computers. The shortcut makes it an easy process to turn off and on as required.

 The shortcut is Shift+S for both platforms.

#### 10Slide a clip within the sequence

 There are a couple of options available here from the shortcuts, slide one frame or 5 frames.

* To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.
* To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.

#### 11Slip within a sequence

 As with the slide options, the choice is one frame or five frames.

* To slip one frame to the left is Control+Alt+Left for PC or Option+Command+Left for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.
* To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.

#### 12Nudging

 You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.

#### 13Multi Camera Selection

 This is a tool that allows you to work with multiple camera angles of the same subject or scene. To switch between different cameras quickly is extremely useful and accomplished with the numerical keys.

 Numbers 1 through 9 select the corresponding camera.

#### 14Add an edit

 This option cuts the track (or tracks) that are targeted. The shortcut for this is Control+K or Command+K.

 You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-6.jpg)

#### 15Add the default Transition

 This option applies the default transition to all selected media. To do this use Shift+D.

#### 16 Match Frame

 Locating a specific frame within the sequence for adding in a second clip is very useful, the shortcut is M, a great timesaver.

#### 17Zoom to sequence

 Being able to zoom in is great, it makes working in the sequence panel much easier, at least for me, however the one drawback I find is that I tend to get lost when looking for a particular clip. Using / enable you to quickly zoom out for navigation and back in again to work

#### 18Jump to Edit

 Navigating from edit to edit is a very simple process with the shortcuts available to you.

 Page up takes you to the previous edit point, whilst page down takes you to the next.

 With practice these shortcuts become second nature and you will find your workflow becomes not only faster but a smoother operation as well.

#### 19Toggle the type of Trim used

 Quickly shift between Standard, Ripple and Roll trim types.

 Shift+T for PC, Control+T for Mac

#### 20Ripple Trim

 This enables you to trim the head or tail of the clip very quickly, making an extremely efficient workflow. To trim the next edit from the Playhead use W, for the previous edit from the playhead use Q.

 There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.

* Navigate Through Fields - Tab
* Cancel Capture - Esc
* Fast Forward - F
* Rewind - R
* Go to In Point - Q
* Go to Out Point - W
* Record - G
* Stop - S
* Step Back - Left Arrow
* Step Forward - Right Arrow

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-2.jpg)

#### 4 Timeline Panel

 In a similar vein to the Capture Panel, the Timeline Panel has a set of shortcuts specific to all its basic operations, and are essential for a faster workflow.

* Clear Ins and Outs - G
* Clear In Point - D
* Clear Out Point - F
* Go to In Point- Q
* Go to Out Point - W
* Match Frame - M
* Start and Stop - Spacebar
* Play Normal Speed - L
* Play Reverse Normal Speed - J
* Set In Point - I
* Set Out Point - o
* Shuttle Stop - K
* Trim - T
* Arc Tool - A
* Ellipse Tool – E

#### 5 Navigation within a clip

 This one works within the program monitor/timeline or source monitor windows, ensure the desired one is active first of course. You can move to a specific time code within the clip, or go forwards or backwards a set number of frames using the number pad. To go to a specific time code simply type that on the number pad. To travel a set number of frames simply type + or – (to signify direction) and the number of frames.

#### 6Marking Clips

 By far the simplest way to mark clips is to use the keyboard shortcut.

 For marking clips use X , whilst marking a selection is / .

#### 7 In and Out

 In addition to marking clips via shortcuts, it is also far easier to mark In and Out points this way.

* To Mark In use I , whilst to mark Out use O .
* To Clear In the shortcut is Control+Shift+I for PC and Option+I for Mac.
* To Clear Out Control+Shift+O for PC, Option+O for Mac.

#### 8Playing Clips

 Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:

* Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac
* Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac
* Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.

 To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit > preferences > playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-5.jpg)

 In addition, turning on looping for this can help to fine tune edits.

#### 9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing

 There are times you may want to hear audio when scrubbing, however turning it off can have beneficial effects on performance for lower end computers. The shortcut makes it an easy process to turn off and on as required.

 The shortcut is Shift+S for both platforms.

#### 10Slide a clip within the sequence

 There are a couple of options available here from the shortcuts, slide one frame or 5 frames.

* To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.
* To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.

#### 11Slip within a sequence

 As with the slide options, the choice is one frame or five frames.

* To slip one frame to the left is Control+Alt+Left for PC or Option+Command+Left for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.
* To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.

#### 12Nudging

 You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.

#### 13Multi Camera Selection

 This is a tool that allows you to work with multiple camera angles of the same subject or scene. To switch between different cameras quickly is extremely useful and accomplished with the numerical keys.

 Numbers 1 through 9 select the corresponding camera.

#### 14Add an edit

 This option cuts the track (or tracks) that are targeted. The shortcut for this is Control+K or Command+K.

 You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-6.jpg)

#### 15Add the default Transition

 This option applies the default transition to all selected media. To do this use Shift+D.

#### 16 Match Frame

 Locating a specific frame within the sequence for adding in a second clip is very useful, the shortcut is M, a great timesaver.

#### 17Zoom to sequence

 Being able to zoom in is great, it makes working in the sequence panel much easier, at least for me, however the one drawback I find is that I tend to get lost when looking for a particular clip. Using / enable you to quickly zoom out for navigation and back in again to work

#### 18Jump to Edit

 Navigating from edit to edit is a very simple process with the shortcuts available to you.

 Page up takes you to the previous edit point, whilst page down takes you to the next.

 With practice these shortcuts become second nature and you will find your workflow becomes not only faster but a smoother operation as well.

#### 19Toggle the type of Trim used

 Quickly shift between Standard, Ripple and Roll trim types.

 Shift+T for PC, Control+T for Mac

#### 20Ripple Trim

 This enables you to trim the head or tail of the clip very quickly, making an extremely efficient workflow. To trim the next edit from the Playhead use W, for the previous edit from the playhead use Q.

 Whilst the conventional mouse control allows you to perform any task that Premiere is capable of, for efficient workflow the keyboard shortcuts cannot be beaten. We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and [Final Cut Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.

---

 This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

---

 This is achieved by going through the path edit > keyboard shortcuts as below:

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shortcut-1.jpg)

 Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I'm sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I'll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.

#### 1Select Window

 I'm starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.

* Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9
* Audio Track Mixer Shift+6
* Effect Controls Shift+5
* Effects Shift+7
* Media Browser Shift+8
* Program Monitor Shift+4
* Project Shift+1
* Source Monitor Shift+2
* Timelines Shift+3

#### 2 Import

 Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.
