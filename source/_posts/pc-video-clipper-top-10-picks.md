## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

## Conclusion

● The fact remains that the efficiency of your editing software or tool has a huge influence on your productivity. And even though choosing the best video trimmer for your next project might seem dicey, following a simple review like this will make it easy to select from the best and try to know what works best for you.

Google Chromecast is a digital media player that allows you to stream MP4, WebM, MPEG-DASH, Smooth Streaming, and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) video formats on your High Definition Television (HDTV). It requires a wireless connection using the Internet or a network-connected computer, tablet, or smartphone. You can play various multimedia content, but only Google Cast-supported formats can be streamed directly.

If you would like to play unsupported formats, such as MKV, VOB, FLV, and AVI, you will need to get a video format converter to stream movies, TV shows, and music videos with unsupported formats. We've picked some best video converters that you can use which also support 4K footage. Check the list of the[best 4K video converters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) here. In this article, you will learn about supported and unsupported video formats and how you can stream them using your Chromecast media player.

## Part 1: Chromecast Supported and Unsupported Video Formats

The default Chromecast video formats are MP4 and WebM. It also supports MPEG-DASH, Smooth Streaming, and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) video files. All other video formats are unsupported. The following information provides a brief introduction of supported and unsupported formats.

**Standard supported Chromecast video formats include:**

* **MP4** \- MPEG 4 or MP4 video files use the standard .mp4 extension. It is most commonly used to store video and audio files.
* **WebM** – An open video format for the web that allows everyone to stream video and audio codecs.

**Some unsupported video formats include:**

* **AVI**  – AVI (Audio Video Interleave), the most common format for audio/video data on the PC, is a multimedia container format with video and audio.
* **MKV**  – The Matroska Multimedia Container holds video, audio, picture, or subtitle tracks in one file.
* **FLV**  – Flash video formats are video files that are streamed over the Internet using the Adobe Flash Player.
* **MOV** – MOV is a multimedia file format that contains one and more tracks of data, such as audio, video or text.
* **VOB** – VOB (Video Object) files are DVD-Video file formats that contain digital video audio, audio, and subtitles relevant to DVDs.
* **3G2** – This is a video container file for audio, video, and text that is an extension of MP4.

What are the differences between each format? Check [What's Video Format?](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Since Chromecast only supports few video formats, it is recommended that you get a[video streaming application](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)that allows you to stream unsupported formats, such as M2TS, 3GP, DIVX, RM, RMVB, ASF, TS, DV, F4V, OGV, TOD. Wondershare Video Converter for example allows you to use Chromecast to stream unsupported formats through your Windows computer to your television.

NewBlueFX started on Windows, and about two years ago, migrated to the Mac in supporting both Adobe Premiere and Apple Final Cut Pro. They sell transition and effects bundles that repair footage, as well as add titles, transitions and visual effects. But the REAL star of their show is an amazing titling package called Titler Pro 3\. The on-air graphic is a great resource to use as Final Cut Pro plugins.

#### 7 [Crumplepop](http://www.crumplepop.com)

**Price** **:** $39 - $99, depending upon the package

The day Final Cut Pro X was first released, Crumplepop bet the ranch and start developing effects exclusively for Final Cut. That dedication has paid off with a rich variety of color tools, GoPro Fisheye Fixers, split screen and other effects. There are lots and lots of goodies to choose from. You can use the plug-in both on Final Cut and Premiere though the price is a little higher. However, you are not sensitive to price, these plug-ins are the best to use.

#### 8 [Red Giant Software](http://www.redgiant.com)

**Price** **:** Range from free to several hundred dollars, depending upon the package

Red Giant Software is another venerable institution in the effects industry. Their industry-leading Trapcode, Colorista, and Primatte keyers set the standard in the industry. Recently, they created "Universe", which allows you to access to a wealth of effects, for a very reasonable fee each month. **Price**: **Price**s range from free to several hundred dollars, depending upon the package.

#### 9 [Intelligent Assistance](http://www.intelligentassistance.com)

**Price** **:** Starting at $9.99, depending upon the package

Any conversation about plugins for Final Cut includes the team at Intelligent Assistance. They provide tools that help with logging footage, generating production reports, and converting projects between versions. Not everyone needs these tools, but when you do, there's nothing better. There are many styles you can choose from the cool Final Cut Pro plugins. If you want to make your titles powerful, this one the best place to go.

#### 10 [Boris FX](http://www.borisfx.com)

**Price** **:** $695 with a free trial

BorisFX is the Swiss-Army-Knife of visual effects. Hundreds of effects, tools, transitions, titles all in one package: Boris Continuum Complete v9\. The effects in this package need to be seen to be believed. Stunning effects, tools that make unwanted elements in the frame disappear, keyers, masks, and more eye-candy than a carnival.

## Conclusion

There are so many other firms that could be mentioned. It almost seems a shame to stop at ten. But all of these companies make excellent products that can give your projects a unique look. Also, most of them provide free trials, so you can experiment with them on your own and see which ones you can't live without.

If you want to know how to make your video powerful without using plug-ins, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the one you should use on Mac. You can use it to make effects in over 50 settings. If titles are important to you, Filmora's video editor also has various title templates free to use. Also, you can customize titles. Besides, audio is the best part you should try when editing. After trying, you will no longer need Final Cut Pro X. Now, download it to have a try (FREE).
