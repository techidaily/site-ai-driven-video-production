## Watch DVDs on Windows 10 for Free: The Best Players

# 10 Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.

The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD[video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the **best free DVD players** on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.

## Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10

Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and [video file formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs. You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.

### 1\. [VLC Media Player by VideoLan](https://www.videolan.org/)

Over the course of the last two decades, VLC has established itself as one of the most versatile media players ever created. This cross-platform app can be used on Macs, PCs, Linux computers and Smartphones to play different types of audio, image and video files. In fact, VLC is probably the most reliable [DVD player](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can find, as it allows you to play DVD and Blu-ray discs effortlessly. However, if you want to [watch videos in 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)or 8K resolution, you must install the VLC 3.0 Vetinari update of the media player.

What’s more, playing a DVD or a Blu-ray with VLC is a simple task you can complete in just a few clicks. The Open Disc option that is located in the player’s Media menu enables you to choose if you would like to open a DVD, VCD, Audio CD or Blu-ray disc. Moreover, you won’t need to install additional  or MPEG-4 codecs, since VLC can play the vast majority of video files regardless of the codec they are using.

**Pros**

* Available to all PC and Mac users for free
* The most versatile media player on the market
* Offers basic video editing options
* Powerful subtitle syncing tools

**Cons**

* The playback of 4K or 8K video files can be choppy

### 2\. [PotPlayer](https://potplayer.daum.net/)

If you are looking for a DVD player that is compatible with all versions of Windows that were released since Windows Vista, PotPlayer might be one of your best options. Besides providing support for all commonly used video file formats and allowing you to play DVDs, [Blu-rays](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or audio CDs, PotPlayer also offers support for different types of 3D glasses. This Windows-based media player is equipped with enhanced H/W Acceleration technology that enables the software to assist the CPU and GPU during the playback of demanding video files.

PotPlayer has all the codecs that are required for the playback of various types of multimedia files, so you don’t have to waste time searching for the codec packs that make possible playing video and audio content that is stored on DVDs or Blu-rays. The media player lets you choose a sound card in case you have more just than one and it supports SRT and SMI, VOB and Blu-ray subtitles.

**Pros**

* Full OpenCodec support
* Provides a unique 3D viewing experience
* Enables users to bookmark chapters
* Compatible with TV, DVD and HDTV devices

**Cons**

* Audio playback options could be better

### 3\. [BlazeDVD](http://www.blazevideo.com/dvd-player/)

This is a powerful multimedia player that enables you to watch even region coded and CSS-encrypted DVDs. However, the free version of BlazeDVD doesn’t allow you to open region coded DVDs and Blu-rays or [add subtitles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to your files. So if you want to gain access to all the features this DVD player has to offer, you must make a one-time payment of $49.96 and upgrade to its Pro version. Both versions of BlazeDVD let you play DVDs, VCDs or SVCDs and allow you to choose between different playback modes.

The Surround Sound support enhances the audio playback and provides a theater-like experience to the viewers. Moreover, you can choose between ten audio filters you can apply to media files you open with BlazeDVD or use the Parental Control feature if you want to restrict the access to violent content to your children. Creating slideshows from still images or recording videos in an MPEG2 file format are also among the options you are going to have at your disposal if you opt for the paid version of BlazeDVD.

**Pros**

* Excellent audio playback capabilities
* Features a learning mode
* Equipped with the Smart Stretch technology
* Multi-core CPU acceleration features enhance the video and audio playback

**Cons**

* The free version of BlazeDVD offers only limited DVD and Blu-ray playback options

### 4\. [5KPlayer](https://www.5kplayer.com/)

In case you are looking for a perfect DVD player for your home theater, 5KPlayer is probably one of the best options you can find on the market. PC and Mac users can install this DVD player on their devices for free and even use it to capture screens in 4K resolution. The AirPlay technology enables mirroring, while you can also use 5KPlayer to download videos from more than 300 websites including platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.

This media player offers a smooth playback of 4K, Full HD and 360° videos, and it enables you to stream audio and video via its DLNA and AirPlay features. Its DXVA2 hardware acceleration helps render HDR 4K and 8K videos in MTS, MKV or VR 360° formats. What’s more 5KPlayer can detect and play stereo, Dolby or DTS multichannel surround sound in MP3, WMA or FLAC file formats. This cross-platform multimedia player is equipped with a built-in radio player and it supports all common subtitle file formats.

**Pros**

* Offers support for a broad range of audio and video files
* Excellent screen capturing tools
* Enables users to download video content from Facebook, Dailymotion, YouTube or Vimeo
* Amazing streaming capabilities

**Cons**

* No Blu-ray support

### 5\. [GOM Media Player](https://www.gomlab.com/gomplayer-media-player/)

Over the years, GOM has emerged as one of the most versatile DVD players for Windows 10 and all other earlier versions of the OS. Its video playback features are nothing short of amazing since GOM enables you to play videos in various resolutions and file formats. However, if you would like to use this media player to open Blu-ray discs you must ensure that you have the necessary codecs. Even so, GOM features a variety of built-in codecs such as Vobris, H263, MP42 or XVID that ensure you can open almost all types of video files.

Besides stunning video playback capabilities that even allow you to view 360° VR videos, GOM also features an extensive subtitle library. The media player searches for subtitles automatically and if it finds a subtitle for a particular video it adds them automatically. Upgrading to the paid version of the GOM media player can be a good idea if you want to get rid of ads or make sure that the playback of 4K UHD video files is smooth.

**Pros**

* Quick and easy installation process
* A rich subtitle library
* Supports a broad range of audio and video files
* Low system requirements

**Cons**

* Additional codecs are required for the playback of Blu-ray discs

### 6\. [MPC-HC (Media Player Classic Home Cinema)](https://mpc-hc.org/)

Even though it has been more than two years since the last and probably the final version of MPC-HC has been released, this media player is still one of the best ways to play DVDs and Blu-rays on Windows 10\. The video and audio playback tools MPC-HC has to offer cannot be compared to those provided by VLC or even GOM media player as it only features the basic options you need to play a DVD or a Blu-ray disc. Moreover, the process of playing a DVD with MPC-HC is quite technical as you must adjust the media player’s settings in order to play content from that source.

The codecs you will have to install on your PC depends on the type of content you would like to watch. MPC-HC provides support for  or  codecs, but it is better to install a full codec pack and ensure that you have all the codecs you need to play audio and video files.
