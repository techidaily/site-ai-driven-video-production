Do you face these kinds of issues a lot while you're shooting through your phone? Although you may make a video at any time using your iPhone or Android smartphone, you are much more likely to face a dull environment that you cannot adjust at the time. Filming in low light may result in a video that is too dark to see clearly and may potentially degrade video quality.

In such cases, employing a video brightness program on your smartphone or Windows computer might be one of the finest ways to brighten a video. Hence, we've compiled a list of some excellent **Video Brightness Editor** tools for you on this page. Read ahead to learn more about their brightness settings and other options.

#### In this article

01 [Best Online Video Editors to Adjust Video Brightness](#part1)

02 [Best Desktop Video Editors to Adjust Video Brightness](#part2)

## Part 1: Best Online Video Editors to Adjust Video Brightness

There are software and internet resources that can assist you in resolving this issue. You may brighten your movies without exerting any effort if you use the correct video brightener application or website. Read about some of this software when you want to learn more about brightening videos.

### **1\.** [**Veed.io**](https://www.veed.io/)

Is it too dark to watch your visuals? There is "light" at the end of the tunnel, so don't panic. You may alter the brightness, contrast, color distribution, backdrop, transparency, and more in your movie using Veed.io color, vibrancy, and flare may be added to your videos.

Alternatively, for a dramatic impact, lower it a little! Our expert brightness editor will bring out the finest in your video, no matter what it is. Launch your preferred web browser, such as Chrome, Opera, or Mozilla Firefox.

Most of the functionality found in the other social network video editors on our list are available, including video templates, ways to resize and cut your video clips, text tools, and even some basic geometric shapes.

You may also convert, trim, resize, and loop videos with at least 15 video tools, many of which are incorporated with the main Studio software. You may perform everything for free and without any hassle. The subtitle tool, for example, is a fantastic tool that allows users to upload subtitles to the industry standard.SRT file.

### 3\. [**Clipchamp**](https://clipchamp.com/en/)
