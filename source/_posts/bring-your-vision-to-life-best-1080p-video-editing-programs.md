Select from trendy, family, business, social, seasonal, fun, and clean editing themes.

### 3\. Kizoa

[Kizoa](https://www.kizoa.com/) is well-known for its extensive transition effects, which may help you create professional-looking films quickly. Kizoa also offers 4K UHD videos in various aspect ratios, including 16:9, 4:3, 3:2, 1:1, and 9:16, 3:4, and 2:3 portraits. That's not even taking into account the software's numerous templates.

![kizoa online video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kizoa-online-video-editor.jpg)

Kizoa's library has a large number of animations and effects which can be used to adapt films to meet the demands of certain editing tasks. Many aspects of video clips will be considerably easier to customize, such as position, size, length, and timing. Because there is no need to log in to obtain all of these amazing features, most pros and novices prefer to utilize Kizoa for their daily requirements.

### 4\. Canva

Another one on our list is the [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), which is as easy and simpler to use as the rest of these. The interface on a computer's web browser is quite straightforward, with a sidebar on the left-side guiding you through all of the stages required to complete your work. You may choose from a variety of templates. They're divided into categories like Education, Reviews, Explainer, Sale, Fashion, Slideshow, YouTube into, and Outro, and so on.

![canva choose video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-choose-video.jpg)

There are dozens of templates to pick from, with some appearing in many categories. Canva makes use of layers to allow things to be put in front of and behind each other. You may view and adjust that function by clicking the 'Position' option. Transparency, filters, color tweaks, cut, and flip are some of the other options available.

### 5\. Adobe Spark

[Adobe Spark](https://www.adobe.com/express/), like Canva, is a video design platform. It enables you to generate a variety of images and social media material for professional or personal usage. Adobe Spark's layout and usability will appeal to you. The primary interface, which appears before you use the editor, is straightforward.

![online adobe spark video maker interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-adobe-spark-video-maker-interface.jpg)

Adobe Spark includes a vast library of templates when you're looking for ideas or motivation for your creations. For organizations who wish to maintain a strong brand image in their material, the Brand area is a must-have element. You may develop new brands with the corporate logo, color palette, and typefaces as the starting point. Adobe Spark features a separate project tab that stores all of your work in one place.

**Conclusion**

Well, there you have it – the best **basic video editors** for beginners. Video editing has grown by ten folds from where it was five or six years ago. Almost anyone can edit a video to an extent. But what takes them to the next level is the use of efficient, effective, and productive software in place to do almost any kind of video editing. If you don’t want to install any software on your computer, you can try these online video editors or the preset video makers; if you want to improve the video quality, desktop software is recommended.
