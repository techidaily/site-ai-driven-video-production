We have eight recommendations for you below that will allow you to pretty much do whatever you want (i.e., **convert FLAC to MP3**, convert **FLAC to ALAC**, **convert WAV to FLAC**, MP4 to FLAC, FLAC to MP4, M4A to FLAC, WAV to FLAC, and so much more.)

We've even included a handy general tutorial just after this to make sure that you're able to easily make use of your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)](#Part 1)

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

![Upload FLAC Audio File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%201.png)

### 02**Step 2: Confirm Output Format!**

For our example, we'll be converting from **FLAC to MP3**. And so, when prompted to choose the desired output format, we choose "MP3"!

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

![Advance Settings Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%203.png)

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

![Select Convert to MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%204.png)

### 05**Step 5: Download Converted FLAC Audio!**

Finally, when the conversion has been completed, select the 'Download MP3' button to save your converted audio to your PC! That's it, you're done!

![Select Download MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%205.png)

But, even more than that, it offers bonus features (i.e., Download, Video Compressor, Video Editor, Content Merger, Screen Converter, etc.)

But, it is, at the very least, 100% FREE.

### 06**Audacity**

**Compatibility**: Windows OS

**What's New**: Advanced Audio Editing Functions!

**Rating and Reviews**: 4/5

**Price**: FREE

When one talks about FREE audio editors, the one most frequently discussed is often Audacity! As you can see, the UI for it is pretty old, but it comes with tons of advanced features. Of course, the one that you're probably most concerned about is its converting functions! For that, we can confirm that Audacity will, in fact, allow you to convert from FLAC or convert to FLAC. The process will be different, but it's possible!

![Audio Software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%2011.png)

**Price**: FREE

The last of the tools on this list, Freemake, is another Windows-only software!

![Freemake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%2013.png)

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Need a quick and easy way to convert from **FLAC to MP3**? How about **WAV to FLAC**? Whether you're converting from or to FLAC, this article has made sure to give you options!

**●** Most **FLAC converter**s, you'll find, work much the same way (demonstrated in our tutorial in Part 1!)

**●** But, despite the similarities, there are multiple unique methods of converting from and to FLAC format that you can use! Hopefully, you'll be able to find one that suits your project from the list that we provided in Part 2!)

We have eight recommendations for you below that will allow you to pretty much do whatever you want (i.e., **convert FLAC to MP3**, convert **FLAC to ALAC**, **convert WAV to FLAC**, MP4 to FLAC, FLAC to MP4, M4A to FLAC, WAV to FLAC, and so much more.)

We've even included a handy general tutorial just after this to make sure that you're able to easily make use of your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)](#Part 1)

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

![Upload FLAC Audio File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%201.png)

### 02**Step 2: Confirm Output Format!**

For our example, we'll be converting from **FLAC to MP3**. And so, when prompted to choose the desired output format, we choose "MP3"!

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

![Advance Settings Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%203.png)

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

![Select Convert to MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%204.png)

### 05**Step 5: Download Converted FLAC Audio!**

Finally, when the conversion has been completed, select the 'Download MP3' button to save your converted audio to your PC! That's it, you're done!

![Select Download MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%205.png)

## Slowing Down the Action: How to Use VLC's Slow Motion Feature

While the files of the most common formats like MP4, WAV, etc. may look identical, they might be compiled using varied codecs which may or may not support any random player that you install on your PC. The reason why VLC media player is used by the majority of users worldwide is the versatility in the codecs that it supports natively.

Furthermore, the app is available for almost every platform, i.e., Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android, and is absolutely free to download and use.

With that said, the following sections explain how to manage the playback speed of a video while using VLC media player to add a slow motion effect to video. Here you will learn **how to play slow motion on VLC** on Windows, Mac, and iOS/Android, and also how to set the default speed for the app so that every time a video is played, the speed remains according to your preference.

#### In this article

01 [How to Play Video in Slow Motion Effects on Windows with VLC?](#part1)

02 [How to Play Slow Motion Effects on Mac with VLC?](#part2)

03 [How to Control Playback Speed in VLC Media Player on Android and iOS?](#part3)

04 [How to Set up the Default Playback Speed on VLC?](#part4)

## Part 1: How to Play Video in Slow Motion Effects on Windows with VLC?

VLC is one of the [best media players to play videos in slow motion](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can follow the instructions that are given below to learn how to play a video in slow motion in VLC on a Windows PC:

**Step 1: Start Video Playback**

Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click **Media** from the menu bar at the top, click **Open File** from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.

![open file to play slow motion on vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-file-to-play-slow-motion-on-vlc.jpg)

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)**

Once the playback begins, press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the **Playback** menu from the top, go to **Speed**, and click **Slower (fine)** once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking **Slower (fine)** again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press **Spacebar** again to resume the playback in slow motion.

**Note:** The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.

![vlc playback slower slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-playback-slower-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)**

Pause the playback and go to **Playback** \> **Speed** as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click **Slower** (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click **Slower** again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press **Spacebar** to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.

**Note:** You can click **Normal** from the **Speed** submenu to play the video at normal speed.

![play video slow motion on vlc slower](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-slower.jpg)

**Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)**

You can press the left square bracket ‘**\[**‘ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to ‘**\=**’ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket ‘**\]**’ increases the speed by 0.10x.

**Note:** As it is with the **Slower (fine)** and **Slower** options, you can use **Faster (fine)** to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and **Faster** to increase percentage-wise. Also, if **Faster (fine)** is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the **Faster** option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.

## Part 2: How to Play Slow Motion Effects on Mac with VLC?

The process of slowing down the video playback in VLC on a Mac computer is almost identical to that in Windows. You can learn how to get this done by following the steps that are given below:

**Step 1: Open and Pause the Video**

Locate and right-click the video that you want to play in slow motion, go to **Open With** from the context menu, and click **VLC** from the submenu. Once the clip opens, click the **Pause** button from the bottom as explained in the previous section.

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Click **Playback** from the menu bar at the top, and drag the **Playback Speed** slider to the left to reduce the speed of the video.

![play video slow motion on vlc mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-mac.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

Click anywhere on the screen to close the **Playback** menu, and then click the **Play** button from the bottom to resume the video playback in slow motion.

## Part 3: How to Control Playback Speed in VLC Media Player on Android and iOS?

Although the playback speed of a video on both Android and iOS devices can be controlled with a slider, the location where the controller is placed on the two platforms varies, and so does the process of reaching there. Both the methods are explained below for your convenience:

### Play Video in Slow Motion on Android with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Launch VLC on your Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations), locate and open the video in VLC, tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Pause** button from the bottom to pause the playback.

**Step 2: Set a Slower Playback Speed**

Tap the **More** icon from the bottom-right corner, tap **Playback speed** from the menu that appears, and drag the slider that is present at the bottom to the left to reduce the speed. Alternatively, you can also repeatedly tap the down arrow that is present at the right of the slider to slow down the speed in the decrements of 0.05x.

![play speed slow motion vlc android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-speed-slow-motion-vlc-android.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

Tap anywhere on the screen, and when the **Playback speed** slider disappears, tap the screen one more time. Now, tap the **Play** icon from the bottom to resume the video playback.

### Play Video in Slow Motion on iPhone with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Assuming that you have already added the video to the VLC library by connecting it to iTunes, launch the app on your iOS device (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations). Tap the video that you want to play in slow motion, and then tap the **Pause** icon from the bottom.

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Clock** icon from the lower-left corner. Next, drag the **Playback speed** slider to the left to reduce the playback speed.

![vlc iphone playback speed slow motion effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-iphone-playback-speed-slow-motion-effect.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

Right after decreasing the speed, tap the **Play** icon from the bottom to resume the playback. If the controllers disappear, you can tap anywhere on the screen again, and then tap the **Play** icon.

## Part 4: How to Set up the Default Playback Speed on VLC?

The processes of setting up default playback speed on different platforms and devices vary. For your convenience, all of them are explained below:

### Set up Default Playback Speed in VLC on Windows

1. Go to **Tools** \> **Preferences** in VLC media player, and then click the **All** button from the **Show settings** section at the bottom.
2. Select **Input / Codecs** from the left pane of the **Advanced Preferences** box, and then specify your preferred speed in the **Playback speed** field that is present under the **Playback control** section on the right window
3. Click **Save** to save the changes

![set vlc media player default playback speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-vlc-media-player-default-playback-speed.jpg)

### Set up Default Playback Speed in VLC on Mac

* Launch VLC, and go to **VLC media player** from the menu bar, and then click **Preferences;** and then click **Show All** from the bottom of the **Preferences** box to display all preferences setting options;

![vlc media player default preferences interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-default-preferences-interface.jpg)

* Click the **Input / Codecs** from the left pane, and then define your preferred speed in the **Playback speed** field under the **Playback control** section in the right window, and then click **Save** to save the changes.

![change vlc media player default speed mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-vlc-media-player-default-speed-mac.jpg)

### How to Change VLC Media Player Default Speed on Android

**Note:** At the time of this writing, the Android version of VLC doesn’t allow you to set a global default playback speed. However, you can set it on a per video basis. This means that every time that video is played, the playback speed will remain what you set for it. You must do this for each video in your VLC library individually.

* Launch VLC, and then tap **More** from the bottom-right corner; next, tap **SETTINGS** from the upper-left area;
* Tap **Video** from the **Extra settings** section, and then check the **Save Playback Speed** box

![change media default playback speed android vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-media-default-playback-speed-android-vlc.jpg)

### How to Change VLC Media Player Default Speed on iOS and iPhone

* Tap **Settings** from the Home screen, and then scroll down and tap **VLC**
* Tap **Default playback speed** from the **GENERIC** section, and then tap to select a playback speed from the available list to set it as the default.

![change default playback speed vlc iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-default-playback-speed-vlc-iphone.jpg)

**Conclusion**

It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.

Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click **Media** from the menu bar at the top, click **Open File** from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.

![open file to play slow motion on vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-file-to-play-slow-motion-on-vlc.jpg)

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)**

Once the playback begins, press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the **Playback** menu from the top, go to **Speed**, and click **Slower (fine)** once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking **Slower (fine)** again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press **Spacebar** again to resume the playback in slow motion.

**Note:** The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.

![vlc playback slower slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-playback-slower-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)**

Pause the playback and go to **Playback** \> **Speed** as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click **Slower** (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click **Slower** again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press **Spacebar** to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.

**Note:** You can click **Normal** from the **Speed** submenu to play the video at normal speed.

![play video slow motion on vlc slower](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-slower.jpg)

**Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)**

You can press the left square bracket ‘**\[**‘ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to ‘**\=**’ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket ‘**\]**’ increases the speed by 0.10x.

**Note:** As it is with the **Slower (fine)** and **Slower** options, you can use **Faster (fine)** to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and **Faster** to increase percentage-wise. Also, if **Faster (fine)** is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the **Faster** option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.

## Part 2: How to Play Slow Motion Effects on Mac with VLC?

The process of slowing down the video playback in VLC on a Mac computer is almost identical to that in Windows. You can learn how to get this done by following the steps that are given below:

**Step 1: Open and Pause the Video**

Locate and right-click the video that you want to play in slow motion, go to **Open With** from the context menu, and click **VLC** from the submenu. Once the clip opens, click the **Pause** button from the bottom as explained in the previous section.

## Part 3: How to Control Playback Speed in VLC Media Player on Android and iOS?

Although the playback speed of a video on both Android and iOS devices can be controlled with a slider, the location where the controller is placed on the two platforms varies, and so does the process of reaching there. Both the methods are explained below for your convenience:

### Play Video in Slow Motion on Android with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Launch VLC on your Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations), locate and open the video in VLC, tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Pause** button from the bottom to pause the playback.

**Step 2: Set a Slower Playback Speed**

Tap the **More** icon from the bottom-right corner, tap **Playback speed** from the menu that appears, and drag the slider that is present at the bottom to the left to reduce the speed. Alternatively, you can also repeatedly tap the down arrow that is present at the right of the slider to slow down the speed in the decrements of 0.05x.

### Play Video in Slow Motion on iPhone with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Assuming that you have already added the video to the VLC library by connecting it to iTunes, launch the app on your iOS device (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations). Tap the video that you want to play in slow motion, and then tap the **Pause** icon from the bottom.

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Clock** icon from the lower-left corner. Next, drag the **Playback speed** slider to the left to reduce the playback speed.

![vlc iphone playback speed slow motion effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-iphone-playback-speed-slow-motion-effect.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

Right after decreasing the speed, tap the **Play** icon from the bottom to resume the playback. If the controllers disappear, you can tap anywhere on the screen again, and then tap the **Play** icon.

## Part 4: How to Set up the Default Playback Speed on VLC?

The processes of setting up default playback speed on different platforms and devices vary. For your convenience, all of them are explained below:

### Set up Default Playback Speed in VLC on Windows

1. Go to **Tools** \> **Preferences** in VLC media player, and then click the **All** button from the **Show settings** section at the bottom.
2. Select **Input / Codecs** from the left pane of the **Advanced Preferences** box, and then specify your preferred speed in the **Playback speed** field that is present under the **Playback control** section on the right window
3. Click **Save** to save the changes

### How to Change VLC Media Player Default Speed on Android

**Note:** At the time of this writing, the Android version of VLC doesn’t allow you to set a global default playback speed. However, you can set it on a per video basis. This means that every time that video is played, the playback speed will remain what you set for it. You must do this for each video in your VLC library individually.

* Launch VLC, and then tap **More** from the bottom-right corner; next, tap **SETTINGS** from the upper-left area;
* Tap **Video** from the **Extra settings** section, and then check the **Save Playback Speed** box

**Conclusion**

It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.

## Part 2: Lumafusion can Run on M1-Based Mac

Yes, it might get inconvenient if you are not used to mouse navigation. Still, all features remain the same, and you can edit the videos to the same level. Plus, given the recent upgrades, LumaFusion has enabled users to change the touch option to mouse and keyboard, so you can customize the options accordingly and even use keyboard shortcuts to work seamlessly.

**How to install Lumafusion**

Here’s how to install LumaFusion on M1-based Mac:

* **Open** the App Store.
* Type in **LumaFusion** in the Search menu.
* Navigate to the right pane and find the LumaFusion application from the list.
* And select **Get** to install the LumaFusion application on M1-based Mac.

Once LumaFusion is installed on the Mac, you can work around the software like on iOS devices. All you have to do is go to **Touch Alternatives** options to change the customizing options.

## Part 3: LumaFusion Alternatives on Mac

Although mighty and powerful, LumaFusion can be an annoyance to some based on personal preference. So, we are listing the two best alternatives of LumaFusion that includes almost all the features and enables you to edit the video to the same level.

### 1\. Wondershare Filmora for Mac\[for beginner and intermediate\]

[**Filmora for Mac**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is suitable for all i.e., beginners, intermediate, and advanced video editors who want to utilize all the professional options yet need a simple interface.  And given this smooth shift from beginners to experts — we recommend Filmora to the beginners and intermediate users who want to make a career or follow their passion for video-editing for years to come.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Coming to the features, Filmora includes all that is needed to enhance the video clips’ quality and give it unique and personalized effects.

Here are the key features of Filmora:

* Intuitive and simple interface, allowing even the least video-editor literates to personalize their videos to the full extent
* Pre-created filters and color pallets to color-correct the videos or you can utilize the professional color wheel and automated color-correction features to allow users to balance the color themselves
* Create simple animations with one-click preset options or take animation into your hands and personalize every aspect of the video manually, including position, size, opacity, and volume
* Includes a library of royalty-free music to incorporate tunes to the videos or you can utilize customizable options to bring consistency to your sound
* Large effects library with numerous customizing options and built-in filters, effects, overlays, and transitions to apply them with one-click

### 2\. [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)\[for professionals\]

![Final Cut Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lumafusion-for-mac-fcp.jpg)

Apple’s native Final Cut Pro X is another perfect alternative that has managed to make the top list when it comes to the best video editing software for the Mac since its release in 2011\. And although it’s a pricey option, Final Cut Pro X offers a 90-day trial period to judge the application for yourself. Of course, the trial version excludes some additional content like extra sound effects, presets, the space designer plugin, and advanced video formats. Still, it should be enough to review the application.

Coming to the features, Final Cut Pro X takes things to a different level and offers you the best-in-trade functions to edit the videos to perfection. Including superior organization tools, libraries, ratings, tagging, auto analysis for faces, scenes — the interface of Final Cut Pro X speaks of the effort the designers have put into the software. Moreover, the multi-cam support, multiple later editing, audio effects, and the recent upgrade of smoothing 360-degree footage and HDR modes have shown that Apple will leave no stone unturned when it comes to perfecting its native professional video-editing tool, i.e., Final Cut Pro X.

However, there is a learning curve if you are new to Final Cut Pro X (regardless of whether you are an expert or not), as it incorporates a unique magnetic, trackless timeline that is not common to the video-editing software. But that initial learning time is worth it because once you start utilizing Final Cut Pro X, you will not see (or like) any other software in the industry — given the regular and timely updates to the application.

## Conclusion

While LumaFusion can be installed on the new M1-Based Macs, it is not that great to work on it (especially, if you are used to the touch version). And that is why this guide list the two-best alternatives to LumaFusion, i.e., Filmora and Final Cut Pro.And we highly recommend Filmora to all non-professional users.

## Part 2: Lumafusion can Run on M1-Based Mac

While LumaFusion does not have a Mac version yet, it made clear that M1-based Mac supports the LumaFusion to run on a macOS environment. Yes, it might get inconvenient if you are not used to mouse navigation. Still, all features remain the same, and you can edit the videos to the same level. Plus, given the recent upgrades, LumaFusion has enabled users to change the touch option to mouse and keyboard, so you can customize the options accordingly and even use keyboard shortcuts to work seamlessly.

**How to install Lumafusion**

Here’s how to install LumaFusion on M1-based Mac:

* **Open** the App Store.
* Type in **LumaFusion** in the Search menu.
* Navigate to the right pane and find the LumaFusion application from the list.
* And select **Get** to install the LumaFusion application on M1-based Mac.

Once LumaFusion is installed on the Mac, you can work around the software like on iOS devices. All you have to do is go to **Touch Alternatives** options to change the customizing options.

## Part 3: LumaFusion Alternatives on Mac

Although mighty and powerful, LumaFusion can be an annoyance to some based on personal preference. So, we are listing the two best alternatives of LumaFusion that includes almost all the features and enables you to edit the video to the same level.

### 1\. Wondershare Filmora for Mac\[for beginner and intermediate\]

[**Filmora for Mac**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is suitable for all i.e., beginners, intermediate, and advanced video editors who want to utilize all the professional options yet need a simple interface.  And given this smooth shift from beginners to experts — we recommend Filmora to the beginners and intermediate users who want to make a career or follow their passion for video-editing for years to come.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Coming to the features, Filmora includes all that is needed to enhance the video clips’ quality and give it unique and personalized effects.

Here are the key features of Filmora:

* Intuitive and simple interface, allowing even the least video-editor literates to personalize their videos to the full extent
* Pre-created filters and color pallets to color-correct the videos or you can utilize the professional color wheel and automated color-correction features to allow users to balance the color themselves
* Create simple animations with one-click preset options or take animation into your hands and personalize every aspect of the video manually, including position, size, opacity, and volume
* Includes a library of royalty-free music to incorporate tunes to the videos or you can utilize customizable options to bring consistency to your sound
* Large effects library with numerous customizing options and built-in filters, effects, overlays, and transitions to apply them with one-click

### 2\. [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)\[for professionals\]

![Final Cut Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lumafusion-for-mac-fcp.jpg)

Apple’s native Final Cut Pro X is another perfect alternative that has managed to make the top list when it comes to the best video editing software for the Mac since its release in 2011\. And although it’s a pricey option, Final Cut Pro X offers a 90-day trial period to judge the application for yourself. Of course, the trial version excludes some additional content like extra sound effects, presets, the space designer plugin, and advanced video formats. Still, it should be enough to review the application.

Coming to the features, Final Cut Pro X takes things to a different level and offers you the best-in-trade functions to edit the videos to perfection. Including superior organization tools, libraries, ratings, tagging, auto analysis for faces, scenes — the interface of Final Cut Pro X speaks of the effort the designers have put into the software. Moreover, the multi-cam support, multiple later editing, audio effects, and the recent upgrade of smoothing 360-degree footage and HDR modes have shown that Apple will leave no stone unturned when it comes to perfecting its native professional video-editing tool, i.e., Final Cut Pro X.

However, there is a learning curve if you are new to Final Cut Pro X (regardless of whether you are an expert or not), as it incorporates a unique magnetic, trackless timeline that is not common to the video-editing software. But that initial learning time is worth it because once you start utilizing Final Cut Pro X, you will not see (or like) any other software in the industry — given the regular and timely updates to the application.

## Conclusion

While LumaFusion can be installed on the new M1-Based Macs, it is not that great to work on it (especially, if you are used to the touch version). And that is why this guide list the two-best alternatives to LumaFusion, i.e., Filmora and Final Cut Pro.And we highly recommend Filmora to all non-professional users.
