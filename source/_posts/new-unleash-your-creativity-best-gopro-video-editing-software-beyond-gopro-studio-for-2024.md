Avidemux is an open-source and cross platform video editing tool which enables users to edit and linearly organize the video projects. Users can also apply audio and video effects to the media. But sometimes you may come across Avidemux no sound issue after exporting the project, which is really annoying. Want to find a solution? Just read on this article.

If Avidemux has no sound, in most cases this is simply because you didn’t enable the sound yet, because Avidemux’s audio output is set to “DUMMY”by default. To fix it, click on the Tools heading, and select its "Preferences" and then switch to the “Audio”tab. Then change "Audio output" to "WIN32" or whatever suits your OS from the "Audio Device" menu box. Finally click the “OK” button. Now you should hear sound. If you still couldn't hear the sound, then something might be wrong with the codec.

In fact, there are various fantastic video editing tools than Avidemux which gives you more editing possibilities without such kind of problem.

Avidemux is an open-source and cross platform video editing tool which enables users to edit and linearly organize the video projects. Users can also apply audio and video effects to the media. But sometimes you may come across Avidemux no sound issue after exporting the project, which is really annoying. Want to find a solution? Just read on this article.

If Avidemux has no sound, in most cases this is simply because you didn’t enable the sound yet, because Avidemux’s audio output is set to “DUMMY”by default. To fix it, click on the Tools heading, and select its "Preferences" and then switch to the “Audio”tab. Then change "Audio output" to "WIN32" or whatever suits your OS from the "Audio Device" menu box. Finally click the “OK” button. Now you should hear sound. If you still couldn't hear the sound, then something might be wrong with the codec.

 You can now easily capture screenshots on your PS4 with the inclusion of the new _SHARE_ button on the DualShock 4 controller. This can be done either through the short or long press settings configured for your _SHARE_ button. Kindly follow me through the different options that you have on how you can capture and share your PS4 screenshots; **Option 1: Through the SHARE button** or; **Option 2: On A Separate Platform**.

## Capture screenshots on PS4 with SHARE button

 You can’t miss the _SHARE_ button on the new controller for the latest PS4\. It’s sitting on the left-hand side of the touch pad (as shown in the screenshot below). A short press on _SHARE_ button (by default) will take you into the Share’s interface. In order to capture a screen shot, you’ll need to perform a long press. Alternatively, change your _Share Settings_ to _Easy Screenshots_ where the press works in contrary of the defaulted settings.

## Use third party software for screenshot sharing

 You can also share your PS4 captured screenshots on a separate platform such as the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can easily drag-and-drop your screenshots on the interface, stitch, personalize with effects and even insert your favorite track as the background music.

 Other than that, you can also convert your screenshots to a file format that’s compatible with your portable device; uploading onto YouTube (with additional options to share on Twitter as well as Facebook); burn your own DVD and much more. Download the trial version and try it out right now.

## Capture screenshots on PS4 with SHARE button

 You can’t miss the _SHARE_ button on the new controller for the latest PS4\. It’s sitting on the left-hand side of the touch pad (as shown in the screenshot below). A short press on _SHARE_ button (by default) will take you into the Share’s interface. In order to capture a screen shot, you’ll need to perform a long press. Alternatively, change your _Share Settings_ to _Easy Screenshots_ where the press works in contrary of the defaulted settings.
