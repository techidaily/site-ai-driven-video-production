 **Why is Audio and Video out of Sync in Final Cut Pro X?**

The audio and video out of sync is a common issue faced by most Final Cut Pro X users. They experience an audio delay in their edited video that gives a bad impression and haunts the user experience.

Whenever you face an out-of-sync problem, don’t assume that the clips in your sequence are also out of sync. Multiple factors can cause sync issues, the most prominent one is by an over-taxing of the processor when it tries to run the program at its maximum. Consequently, the overstressed processer fails to sync audio and video accordingly and causes a delay.

* Set the Canvas size to “Fit Window”
* Prevent the Canvas and Viewer from overlapping

* Set the control panel resolution must be to 75A Hz or higher
* Do not select too many real-time audio tracks
* Turn off the Mirror to Desktop option

* Render the video sequence to a single file.

## Part 2: How to Auto-sync in Final Cut Pro X?

Final Cut Pro X is an advanced and user-friendly video editing application. Its auto-sync feature automatically analyzes the audio and video clips selected in your timeline and allows you to sync video with audio.

To use this feature, use multiple audio and video clips recorded from different resources during the same take. Once you have selected, Final Cut Pro will automatically start analyzing the clips for sync points like date of file creation, markers, audio content, and time code, etc. After analyzing the clips, the syncing process will begin in which these audio and video clips will be synced together into a new clip without affecting the original clip. Even if your clips do not have any sync points, Final Cut Pro X will sync them at their respective starting points.

## Part 2: How to Add Plugins to Final Cut Pro X

The first step for installing any plugin is to get out of Final Cut Pro X if you have it open. You can refer to the steps below to install various kinds of Final Cut Pro X plugins.

#### Step 1: Download the Plugin

Go to your favorite site of plugins and search for tools. Here, we are referring to download the transition tools. Click the **Add to Cart** tab as shown in the image below.

![top 10 free fcpx plugins download transition tools](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-download-transition-tools.jpg)

You will get its download in the form of a zip folder, which you have to unzip for sure.

Here, we have downloaded two transitions contained within one folder.

#### Step 2: Copy and Paste the Plugin

Now, you need to copy the plugin by right-clicking the entire folder, as shown below.

![top 10 free fcpx plugins copy plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-copy-plugin.jpg)

Afterward, find the **Final Cut Pro X** in **Applications** folder from the **Finder** tab. Right-click the Final Cut Pro X and hit the **Show Package Content** option.

![top 10 free fcpx plugins show package contents](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-show-package-contents.jpg)

Then go to **Contents** \> **Plugins** \> **Media Providers** \> **Motion Effects.fxp** \> **Contents** \> **Resources** \> **Templates** \> **Transitions**.

Paste the item in the **Transition** folder as shown below.

Finally, there is one last step you need to do with the original files of the transition plugin.

Hit the first transition from the folder that you have just pasted. And, rename the white file that is the actual transition plugin with extension **.motr**. You are required to do the same thing with other transitions' folders.
