 In addition, the maximum number of frames a stop motion video created with Instagram can have is limited to just ten.

### Frequently Asked Questions: Why Can’t I See the Stop Motion Feature in Instagram Stories?

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still in its beta stage, which means that it isn’t available on all versions of the app. So, if you can’t see this option you must go to Google Play or Apps Store and install the version of Instagram that has this feature. If the issue persists, you should opt for some other stop motion app you can use free of charge. ;

## Part 2: 3 Best Stop Motion Apps you can Use to Create Animated Videos for Instagram

 You shouldn’t worry if the stop motion feature isn’t available on the version of Instagram you’re using, because there are so many apps that are equipped with this tool. With so many different options on the market, finding the app that provides you with all features you need to create stop motion videos can be a difficult task. That’s why we shortlisted the three best apps for iPhones and Android devices that enable you to make animated stop motion videos for Instagram.

### 1\. [Over](https://www.madewithover.com/)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchase

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

 Over allows you to do much more than just create stop motion videos you can post on Instagram since it is equipped with a versatile set of tools that can help you improve the brand awareness on social media. There are more than 700 [templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to choose from and each of them enables you to adjust your photos and videos to the social network’s demands. However, the free version of the app offers only limited capabilities, and you must upgrade to the Pro version if you want to have access to all photo and video editing tools Over have to offer.

### 2\. Mojo

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/mojo-create-video-stories/id1434861974), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=video.mojo)

![create stop motion video for IG in Mojo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mojo-create-video-stories.jpg)

 Creating content for social media with Mojo is a simple process that can be completed in just three easy steps. You don’t even need a Mojo account to start creating stories with this app. All you have to do is select an animated template, import videos or photos and edit it before tapping on the share button. There are more than a hundred animated templates to choose from, so after you pick one, you just have to [add text overlays](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but you must purchase Mojo Pro if you want to [change aspect ratios](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), duplicate stories or have access to all text styles and templates.

### 3\. [Life Lapse](https://www.lifelapseapp.com/)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/life-lapse-stop-motion-camera/id1281464378), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifelapse&hl=en)

![Life Lapse Stop Motion Maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/life-lapse-stop-motion-camera.jpg)

 The fact that more than a million video content creators and brands are using Life Lapse to make stop motion videos says a lot about the app’s capabilities. Unlike Over and Mojo, Life Lapse lets you set the exposure and focus locks, switch on a grid or use the ghosted image overlay. Besides capturing photos and videos, the app also allows you to import photos you want to include in the stop motion animation. Furthermore, even the free version of Life Lapse offers a variety of video editing tools that allow you to crop images or adjust saturation, brightness or white balance values in each frame.

## Part 3: How to Create a Stop Motion Videos with Life Lapse

 You don’t have to be a skilled cinematographer to make a stop motion video using the Life Lapse app. Once you’ve installed and launched Life Lapse you should create a new project by tapping on the + icon. As soon as the camera loads you’ll be asked to choose if you would like to create a photo or a video project. Tap on the photo option and start taking photos of the objects or people you want to include in your stop motion video.

 The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds. Furthermore, changing a video’s aspect ratio to 9:16 is recommended, as it will enable you to know exactly how your stop motion video is going to look like after you upload it to Instagram.

## Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram

 The process of making a stop motion animation is not technically complicated since you just need to place your phone on a [tripod](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and take a photo each time you move an object in the shot. Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.

### 1\. Develop a concept

 What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.

### 2\. Shoot in studio conditions

 Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.

**Conclusion**

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos. Which app are you using to create stop motion videos? Leave a comment and let us know.

## Part 1: How to Make a Stop Motion Video on Instagram?

 The technical side of making a stop motion video on Instagram is rather simple since you can enable this feature in just a few taps. After you launch the app, you should tap on the **Camera** icon in the upper left corner of the screen. The new window will open where you can choose the type of Instagram story you want to create, so you can pick to [go live](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), record a video normally or use the app’s Boomerang feature.

 You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.

 Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten.

### Cons of Making Stop Motion Videos with Instagram

 Even though Instagram’s new stop motion feature offers an easy way to make your stories more interesting, it still has a few downsides. [Adding sound or music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to stop motion videos you create with Instagram isn’t possible at the moment, and you can’t do much more other than downloading the video to your device.

 Like all other Instagram stories, stop motion videos created with this app are only available for 24 hours if you don’t save them on your phone. Moreover, [downloading the stories you create with Instagram](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)’s stop motion tool will enable you to edit them with [video editing apps for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Android devices and post them to any social media platform you choose.

 In addition, the maximum number of frames a stop motion video created with Instagram can have is limited to just ten.

### Frequently Asked Questions: Why Can’t I See the Stop Motion Feature in Instagram Stories?

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still in its beta stage, which means that it isn’t available on all versions of the app. So, if you can’t see this option you must go to Google Play or Apps Store and install the version of Instagram that has this feature. If the issue persists, you should opt for some other stop motion app you can use free of charge. ;

## Part 2: 3 Best Stop Motion Apps you can Use to Create Animated Videos for Instagram

 You shouldn’t worry if the stop motion feature isn’t available on the version of Instagram you’re using, because there are so many apps that are equipped with this tool. With so many different options on the market, finding the app that provides you with all features you need to create stop motion videos can be a difficult task. That’s why we shortlisted the three best apps for iPhones and Android devices that enable you to make animated stop motion videos for Instagram.

### 1\. [Over](https://www.madewithover.com/)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchase

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

 Over allows you to do much more than just create stop motion videos you can post on Instagram since it is equipped with a versatile set of tools that can help you improve the brand awareness on social media. There are more than 700 [templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to choose from and each of them enables you to adjust your photos and videos to the social network’s demands. However, the free version of the app offers only limited capabilities, and you must upgrade to the Pro version if you want to have access to all photo and video editing tools Over have to offer.

### 2\. Mojo

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/mojo-create-video-stories/id1434861974), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=video.mojo)

![create stop motion video for IG in Mojo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mojo-create-video-stories.jpg)

 Creating content for social media with Mojo is a simple process that can be completed in just three easy steps. You don’t even need a Mojo account to start creating stories with this app. All you have to do is select an animated template, import videos or photos and edit it before tapping on the share button. There are more than a hundred animated templates to choose from, so after you pick one, you just have to [add text overlays](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but you must purchase Mojo Pro if you want to [change aspect ratios](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), duplicate stories or have access to all text styles and templates.

### 3\. [Life Lapse](https://www.lifelapseapp.com/)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/life-lapse-stop-motion-camera/id1281464378), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifelapse&hl=en)

![Life Lapse Stop Motion Maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/life-lapse-stop-motion-camera.jpg)

 The fact that more than a million video content creators and brands are using Life Lapse to make stop motion videos says a lot about the app’s capabilities. Unlike Over and Mojo, Life Lapse lets you set the exposure and focus locks, switch on a grid or use the ghosted image overlay. Besides capturing photos and videos, the app also allows you to import photos you want to include in the stop motion animation. Furthermore, even the free version of Life Lapse offers a variety of video editing tools that allow you to crop images or adjust saturation, brightness or white balance values in each frame.

## Part 3: How to Create a Stop Motion Videos with Life Lapse

 You don’t have to be a skilled cinematographer to make a stop motion video using the Life Lapse app. Once you’ve installed and launched Life Lapse you should create a new project by tapping on the + icon. As soon as the camera loads you’ll be asked to choose if you would like to create a photo or a video project. Tap on the photo option and start taking photos of the objects or people you want to include in your stop motion video.

 The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds. Furthermore, changing a video’s aspect ratio to 9:16 is recommended, as it will enable you to know exactly how your stop motion video is going to look like after you upload it to Instagram.

## Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram

 The process of making a stop motion animation is not technically complicated since you just need to place your phone on a [tripod](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and take a photo each time you move an object in the shot. Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.

### 1\. Develop a concept

 What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.

### 2\. Shoot in studio conditions

 Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.

**Conclusion**

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos. Which app are you using to create stop motion videos? Leave a comment and let us know.

Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)

Ultra HD, often known as 4K resolution, is 3840 x 2160 pixels technically. It looks similar to 2K to the viewers but gives videomakers some room to zoom in or edit.

![File Size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-2.jpg)

## Part 4 Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?

* 720p is also popular with the name HD (high-definition). It is a display resolution that measures 1280 x 720 pixels.
* 480p often known as Standard Definition (SD). It usually starts at 240 p and ends at 480 p. So, 480 p is a semi-HD.
* 960 X 480 p is a progressive camera scan format usually used in surveillance cameras, webcams, or action POV cams. It adds a wide horizontal view as compared to the standard definition. But it is less than HD.

## Part 5 Is HD 2K or 1K?

1K means there are 1000 pixels. So 1080p, as in the vertical portion of a screen, is 1K. In contrast, a typical 1080p resolution with the horizontal part is 1920, or 2K.

Although 1080p has the exact vertical resolution like DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution. As a result, it is below the range of 2K resolution formats.

1080p is almost equivalent to 2K. It is because "p" and "i" measure the height of an image in pixels, while "K" measures the width of an image in thousands of pixels.

So with a size of 1080 pixels, the corresponding width of 1920 pixels uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.

Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)

Ultra HD, often known as 4K resolution, is 3840 x 2160 pixels technically. It looks similar to 2K to the viewers but gives videomakers some room to zoom in or edit.

![File Size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-2.jpg)

## Part 4 Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?

* 720p is also popular with the name HD (high-definition). It is a display resolution that measures 1280 x 720 pixels.
* 480p often known as Standard Definition (SD). It usually starts at 240 p and ends at 480 p. So, 480 p is a semi-HD.
* 960 X 480 p is a progressive camera scan format usually used in surveillance cameras, webcams, or action POV cams. It adds a wide horizontal view as compared to the standard definition. But it is less than HD.

## Part 5 Is HD 2K or 1K?

1K means there are 1000 pixels. So 1080p, as in the vertical portion of a screen, is 1K. In contrast, a typical 1080p resolution with the horizontal part is 1920, or 2K.

Although 1080p has the exact vertical resolution like DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution. As a result, it is below the range of 2K resolution formats.

1080p is almost equivalent to 2K. It is because "p" and "i" measure the height of an image in pixels, while "K" measures the width of an image in thousands of pixels.

So with a size of 1080 pixels, the corresponding width of 1920 pixels uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.
