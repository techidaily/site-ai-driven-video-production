VideoPad Video Editor is compatible with both Mac and Windows computers and supports a number of video import and export options. This nch video editor comes with a free basic plan where you don't have to pay anything, so you can try to see how it works. In this article, we will do a quick review of this video editing software so that you have a better understanding of its features.

## **Features of VideoPad**

The features list of videopad video editor is as follows:

### **Ease of use and interface**

With VideoPad's easy-to-use interface and well-organized conventions, movie makers of any skill level can become familiar with its basics in no time at all. You will become fluent in no time at all in opening and closing windows, stringing clips together, and adding narration, transitions, and text to create a powerful visual presentation. Adding video, audio, and still, photo assets to the files pane will put them on the timeline and allow you to assemble your story.

Videos and still images are organized into bins by the app, ensuring they don't get confused on the timeline, which speeds up the workflow, especially for newcomers.

The app uses menus and can be dragged and dropped, so a single objective can be accomplished in different ways. You can control all functions from within the application frame, or dockable panels can be used to get a closer look at what needs to be done. A permanent reorganization of the workspace would be appreciated.

### **Videopad Video Editing Features**

VideoPad is the perfect balance between too much and not enough. Although there are not many options, it offers a reasonable selection of transitions for moving between clips and images, as well as a selection of filters to give them a unique look. In addition to editing 360-degree video, video stabilization is another helpful feature.

Each filter can be previewed with a click before applying it, and You can combine several to create a custom effect or template for reuse. You can also adjust their length via menus.

A video can be enhanced with transitions, visual effects, overlays, and text using VideoPad. Also included are some basic audio tools and a library of sound effects and atmospheric background music. There are a number of features that allow you to optimize videos, including color correction, adding digital images, adding subtitles, and adjusting the speed of playback. With its video stabilization feature, you can reduce camera shake, and the high-end version supports special effect plugins, but only for Windows.

### **Videopad Audio Editing Features**

VideoPad offers a limited set of audio tools, but it does allow you to mix multiple audio tracks, music, and narration to create a movie soundtrack. A video clip's audio can be faded, mixed, and adjusted for volume, but if you want to go further, you'll need an external mixer or editor. From VideoPad's main menu, you can download NCH's own WavePad.

While the text-to-speech features always sounded false, you can record narration directly within the program. There is a great idea in having voice recognition for subtitles, which is only available on the Windows version. However, the implementation falls short of expectations. Although the video was clearly spoken in a quiet environment, it automatically failed to translate into subtitles.

### **Videopad Content Sharing features**

Video creators who publish to YouTube or other social media platforms can use the software because it allows them to share videos directly to platforms such as Dropbox, Flickr, Google Drive, and Vimeo. To avoid unnecessary data sharing, you can save videos to your desktop and upload them yourself.

### **Is VideoPad worth buying?**

Although the VideoPad video editor free version is somewhat limited, it functions as a free trial to see if you like it enough to upgrade. Apps that are easy to use and have a simple interface can help convert a free user to a paying customer, and VideoPad has a strong claim to your money thanks to its simplicity and light hardware requirements.

Converting a video saved on your phoneâ€™s camera roll to MP3 with the MP3 Converter â€“ Audio Extractor requires you to just select a file and start the conversion process.

However, you wonâ€™t have any control over the bitrate of the output file or any other settings that can increase the quality of the MP3 youâ€™re generating. Moreover, the app offers only modest file-sharing options, and you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to gain access to all features the MP3 Converter â€“ Audio Extractor has to offer.

#### 3. [Video to MP3 â€“ Convert Audio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-to-mp3-convert-audio/id1400653079)

However, you wonâ€™t have any control over the bitrate of the output file or any other settings that can increase the quality of the MP3 youâ€™re generating.

#### 1. [Video to MP3 Music Player](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-to-mp3-converter-music/id1141413448)

**Price:**  Free, but offers-in app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter app for ios ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-to-mp3-music-player.jpg)

Converting an MP4 file from your video library into a high-quality MP3 audio file with this app is a simple 3-step process. You just have to tap on the + button, select a file you want to convert and hit the Convert button. You can also specify the time intervals at which you would like the file conversions to take place and create MP3 files without any quality loss. The app supports all frequently used video file formats, so you can convert videos that are saved in a broad range of formats. As its name indicates, Video to MP3 Music Player lets you play music, and it also enables you to share MP3 files to WhatsApp, Messenger, and other apps.

#### 2. [The Audio Converter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-audio-converter/id889643660)

**Price:**  Free, but offers-in app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter for ios ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-audio-converter.jpg)

The Audio Converter app lets you convert both video and audio files to a broad range of audio file formats. You can convert MP4, m4v, amr, MPEG files formats among numerous others to MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG, and other audio file formats. All conversions take place on a cloud server, which means that you canâ€™t use The Audio Converter while your iPhone is offline. Keep in mind that the free version of the app offers only limited functionalities and you must purchase either Premium Pass or Lifetime Pass if you want to use it to convert MP4 to MP3 on a constant basis.

#### 3. [Video to MP3 â€“ Convert Audio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-to-mp3-convert-audio/id1400653079)

**Price:**  Free, but offers in-app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter for ios ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-to-mp3-convert-audio.jpg)

iPhone owners in need of an app that can convert MP4 to MP3 in fifteen seconds should consider installing this app on their devices. You can convert all videos stored on your phoneâ€™s camera roll or you can import a video from Dropbox, One Drive, iCloud and other online file hosting platforms. Video to MP3 â€“ Convert Audio lets you set the starting and ending points of the new audio file, which means that you can convert only a portion of an MP4 video file to MP3\. All videos you convert to MP3 can be shared on social media or messaging apps and you can transfer all converted files to a computer using the iTunes File Sharing feature.

#### 4. [MP3 Converter â€“ Audio Extractor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mp3-converter-audio-extractor/id1305099161)

**Price:**  Free, but offers in-app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter  for ios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mp3-converter-audio-extractor.jpg)

Converting a video saved on your phoneâ€™s camera roll to MP3 with the MP3 Converter â€“ Audio Extractor requires you to just select a file and start the conversion process. You wonâ€™t even have to specify the output format, because MP3 is the appâ€™s default output format. After the conversion, you can listen to the file you created to make sure that its quality is at a satisfying level. However, you wonâ€™t have any control over the bitrate of the output file or any other settings that can increase the quality of the MP3 youâ€™re generating. Moreover, the app offers only modest file-sharing options, and you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to gain access to all features the MP3 Converter â€“ Audio Extractor has to offer.

#### 5. [Media Converter â€“ Video to MP3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/media-converter-video-to-mp3/id1294207675)

**Price:**  Free, but offers in-app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter for ios ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-converter-video-to-mp3.jpg)

Besides extracting audio from video, you can use the appâ€™s built-in media player to watch videos or listen to music. Media Converter â€“ Video to MP3 supports a broad range of input file formats and it lets you convert them to MP3, M4A, WAV, and other audio file formats. This app lacks more advanced MP4 to MP3 file conversion options since you canâ€™t select the preferred bitrate of the output files or add tags to them. The app contains ads, and you must make an in-app purchase in order to remove them. Even the Pro version of the Media Converter â€“ Video to MP3 doesnâ€™t offer the file-sharing options.
