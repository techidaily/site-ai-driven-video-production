Shrinking multiple videos with Video Slimmer won’t take too much of your time, although the duration of the compression process depends on the size of the video clips. Click on the **\+ icon** after you launch the app, in order to select the videos from the camera roll.

Tap on the **Gear icon** located in the lower right corner of the screen if you would like to adjust the **Video Quality and Video Size** settings. In addition, the Video Slimmer App lets you choose if you want to delete the original videos from your device after the compression or add a copy of the video to the Photo Library.

Head back to the app’s main menu and tap on the **Slim Now button** to start compressing the videos you selected. After reducing the size of your videos you can share them on social media or send them to your friends much faster than the original high-resolution files.

The only limiting factor are the output file formats because the app only allows you to save shrunk videos as **MPEG-4 and QuickTime files**.

 All the compressed videos can be easily shared on social media or sent through email and messaging apps directly from Video Compress.

#### How to shrink video size with this app?

Identifying large video files on your camera roll won’t take too much time since the app **displays the size of all videos**. Besides compressing videos, the Video Compressor app also lets you shrink photos you store on your iPhone or iPad.

Select a video you want to compress, by simply tapping on it, and then **choose a preset resolution** to which that video clip is going to be compressed. Optionally, you can **change the Bitrate** before tapping on the Compression button.

After the video compression process is over you can organize the shrunk videos effortlessly, however, you **must purchase the Pro version** of the app if you want to have access to all of the tools Video Compressor has to offer.

## Is there any iPhone free video compressor with editor built in?

Editing a video before you share it on social media can help you get rid of unwanted parts and make the colors more vivid. **iMovie** is an excellent choice if you would like to **trim a video or add filters and effects to it and reduce the video size**. What’s more, you can use this iOS-native video editing app to reduce the size of the original video files.

Once you complete all video editing tasks you should exit the app’s **Edit window** by tapping done and then tap on the **Share/Save Video** option. iMovie offers a variety of output video file formats, so you can choose if you want to save your video in **360p, 540p, HD or 4K resolution**. After you pick a preferred output resolution the iMovie is going to add the video to the Photo Library.

## Bonus: How to reduce video size on iPhone & iPad when recording?

All recent iPhone and iPad models support recording in a broad spectrum of video resolutions. If you would like to **decrease the resolution** at which your device captures videos you should head to the **Settings menu** and tap on the Camera option.

Select **Record Video** from the Camera menu and then choose the new resolution for your videos. The default resolution is set at 1080p at 30fps, but you can easily reduce it to 720p at 30fps if you want to create videos that don’t take too much storage space.

The **Record Slo-Mo option** lets you choose between 720p HD at 120fps or 720p HD at 240 fps which allows you to preserve storage space while recording high-quality slow-motion videos.
