Currently, there are only a handful of 8K video editors you can use to process footage captured in 8K resolution professionally.

Even so, 8K video files can be edited with some [powerful video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). In this article, we are going to take you through some of the **best 8K video editing software** products on the market and help you select the app that can cater to all of your video editing needs.

### 2\. Adobe Premiere Pro - for 8K video editing

**Price:** $20,99 per month as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Importing and editing 8K footage with Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2019 isn’t any different than editing videos captured in lower resolutions. However, this video editing software for Mac and PC computers **doesn’t let you choose the 8K resolution from its Export window**. That is why you must adjust a project’s resolution from the Sequence Settings window before you actually start manipulating the footage.

So if you change the Editing mode to Custom and you set the resolution of a sequence to 7680 x 4320, Adobe Premiere Pro will allow you to export your video in the 8K resolution.

Keep in mind that you must also change the codec to  from the Export Settings window in order to get the maximum video quality. Optionally, you can experiment with different export settings depending on the type of project you’re working on and the quality of the output file you would like to create.

Despite the fact that the process of creating 8K videos with Adobe Premiere Pro is a bit technical, this 8K video editing software is still one of the best options you can find on the market. Moreover, the video editing tools you’ll have at your disposal if you choose to edit your 8K videos with this video editing app are going to enable you to produce professional-looking videos.
