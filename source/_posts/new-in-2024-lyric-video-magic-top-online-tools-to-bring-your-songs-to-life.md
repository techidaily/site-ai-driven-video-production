**Step 2:**  After uploading the video, activate the tool and choose the portion of the video that you need to stabilize. Once selected, click the “Play” button to see the results.

**Step 3:**  Next, choose your output video format from the options by selecting the gear icon. By default, the tool is set to MP4 output, so make sure to change it if you want to download the video in your preferred format.
