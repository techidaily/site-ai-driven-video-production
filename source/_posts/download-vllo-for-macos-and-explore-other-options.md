### Second part, other free 3GP cutters for users

Wondershare 3GP Cutter allows you to not only cut or trim your 3GP videos, but also offers you a variety of other cool editing features so that you are able to easily make Hollywood-like movies at the ease of your home. If however, you are just looking for some free and simple 3GP Cutting tools, say you don't have any other editing needs, then these following free 3GP cutters will be worth your consideration. We've listed three of them which we consider as the best for your reference.

#### 2.) [Free Video Cutter](http://www.free-video-cutter.org/)

Free Video Cutter is a free cutting tool which enables you to cut your 3GP video with ease. Not only does the software support 3GP but it can also cope with several other video formats. The cutting process itself is simple, it takes into account audio and even subtitles and lets you worry only about the precise point you wish to cut your video, as a good cutting application should do.

#### 3.) Moo0 Video Cutter

Another very easy to use program which supports 3GP. It creates a copy of the section you want to cut and retained, leaving you worry free to do what you wish with the original file. Video formats supported are less than Free Video Cutter. Be sure to check if your original file is supported if you are cutting video clips other than 3GP.

#### 4.) [Weeny Free Video Cutter](http://www.weenysoft.com/free-video-cutter.html)

This program adds another useful talent to the mix, being able to convert cuts to another format on the fly, and even adjust frame rates, audio settings and so on. As you may expect, with these added features the interface of this video cutter is a little busier, but it is still straightforward to operate and anyone can start cutting videos within five minutes of starting to use it. A well featured piece of software than can cut your 3GP files and many other video formats too.
