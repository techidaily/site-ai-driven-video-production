![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step1.png)

**Step 02:** Import the video that you want to react to and your reaction video. If you have not already recorded your reaction, then record it first using any camera or smartphone.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step2.png)

**Step 03:** Place both of these videos into the timeline. Make sure to place your reaction above.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step3.png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step3.png)

**Step 04:** Select your reaction video on the timeline and go to the "Effects". Here you will find a new folder named "AI Portrait", open it. Here you will find multiple AI portrait effects.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step4.png)

**Step 05:** Our goal is to remove the background of the reaction. To do that, we will use Human Segmentation. Drag and drop Human Segmentation into the reaction video. If you haven't purchased this effect already, it will ask you to buy it to export the video. But you want to try it first, click on "Try It."

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5.png)

**Step 06:** Once the effect is successfully applied to the video, its background will be removed automatically.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step6.png)

**Step 07:** Adjust the video by making it smaller and place it in the bottom left corner of the screen. Your reaction video is ready to be uploaded on video-sharing platforms.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step7.png)

**Step 08:** To make your video look cool and stunning, you can also add multiple other effects to your reaction. AI portrait allows you to add a border around the character to make it look more visible and separate it from another video. Go to the AI portrait and drag Human Border Effect and drop it into your reaction. It will create an outline around the character and make it look more visible.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8.png)

**Step 09:** In some instances, you might need to change the position or size of your reaction. You can easily do that by applying the Keyframes to it. If you feel like changing the part of your reaction at some point in the video, go to that point in the timeline and click on the keyframe button above the timeline.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9.png)

**Step 10:** Once you click on the keyframe, it will add a keyframe to the video. Now move forward into the timeline to a point and adjust your character's position by dragging it. Let's move it to the bottom right corner. It will add another keyframe to the video in the timeline. Now the character will change its position from the left corner to the right corner once it reaches that specific point in time.
