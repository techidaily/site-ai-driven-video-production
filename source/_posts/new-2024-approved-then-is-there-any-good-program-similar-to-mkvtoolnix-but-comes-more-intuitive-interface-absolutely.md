A blue marker will be on the video timeline. Similarly, you can place markers on places wherever required.

**Step 3: Apply jump cuts**

Lastly, to apply quick jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro, tap the speed icon from the timeline where you will get various options from which you need to click the “**Jump Cuts at Markers**” option.

You can specify the frame range based on which the jump cuts will get executed in the video.

## Part 2: How to Fix a Jump Cut in Final Cut Pro X?

If you do jump cuts with markers in FCPX, you do not need to fix it, but if you opt for the other way of cut and delete, you must set them for a smoother process. Let's take a look at **how to fix a jump cut** by transition addition.

**Step 2**. To fix jump cuts, place the pointer on the clip, and tap the transition icon from the timeline menu with various options. Primarily "**Flow**" transition option is used in FCPX.

Tap any option, and Final Cut Pro X will automatically apply it to the clip.

## Part 3: How to Hide Jump Cuts in Final Cut Pro X?

Want to hide jump cuts in Final Cut Pro X? Then, here is the session to know **how to hide jump cuts** in FCPX with two options: resizing the video clip and synchronizing clips.

**Method 1: Resizing the clip**
