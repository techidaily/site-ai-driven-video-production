As we use our mobile phones for producing and watching videos more and more every year, the demand for advanced options is constantly on the rise. Split screen is one of such options that users expect from their video apps nowadays, and products that include it stand a better chance to gain a steady foothold in the market. As a response, many new video tools equipped with the [split screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are being launched, but not all of them offer the same level of technical quality and user experience.

To help you differentiate between the competing apps and select the one that works best for you, we prepared an overview of the best split screen video apps for iOS and Android you can use to record, create, and share great-looking multimedia with minimal effort.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

This is Apple’s own video app and it is generally regarded as one of the better in its class, especially considering it’s free to download. The app allows users to shoot, edit, and publish their videos and basically acts as a full-scale portable production studio capable of creating professional-looking movie trailers or even short films. Among the numerous advanced features, iMovie supports split-screen and picture-in-picture options, while also making it very simple to add titles or credits in a wide variety of styles. Because of this, it can be sufficient for anyone whose editing needs are not too complex. Even professional users can start working in iMovie before switching to a more robust Apple editing tool such as Final Cut Pro X.

### 2\. [PicPlay Post Movie Video Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flambestudios.picplaypost&hl=en)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - PicPlayPost ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-movie-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile tool can be used to create and edit video clips or photo collages with a broad range of eye-catching features. It supports the split screen option with up to 9 tiles organized in a 3 x 3 pattern, and offers a lot of pre-defined backgrounds and layouts. Most importantly, you can choose between 9:16 and 16:9 aspect ratios, so the outgoing clips are ready for sharing on any social media platform in landscape or portrait orientation. It’s perfect for creating simple side-by-side comparisons as well as more complex collages that consist of still photos, GIFs, and video clips. The app is easy to use and requires very little training to achieve spectacular results.

### 3\. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-collage-and-photo-grid/id779353036)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Collage and Photo Grid ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

The advantage of any specialized app is that it can perform the chosen function very well, and in the case of a video collage app that means a lot of split screen presets and customization opportunities. You can choose from 64 different layouts featuring up to four videos that can play at the same time. All layouts can be manually adjusted to get the best possible fit with your content, while frame textures can be changed as well. The resulting video collage can be combined with music for a true multimedia feel. Instant preview is a very useful feature as well since it allows the authors to experiment freely while they are searching for the perfect layout of the screen.

### 4\. [Split Screen Video](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/split-screen-videos/id1141913470#?platform=iphone)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** $2.99

![Split Screen Video Making App -Split Screen Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-videos-app.jpg)

With this simple digital tool, you can easily combine from two to four videos into a great, dynamic clip. This is an Apple-only application and has a modest price considering the range of its features. Videos can be placed into frames, and their size and style can be adjusted at will so that some tiles are larger than others. For those who enjoy speed and convenience, there are six preset layouts that can be used to quickly put together a stunning split screen video. Since the interface is extremely user-friendly, this can take as little as a few minutes to execute.

### 5\. [Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/perfect-video-editor-collage/id633335631)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perfect-video-editor-collage.jpg)

There are numerous advantages of this split screen video app, starting from the simplicity of use that makes it ideal for beginners and casual users. Perfect Video Editor supports practically every aspect ratio you can think of, so it works well as a universal editing tool regardless of the intended use of the video. The split screen feature is sadly limited to just two video channels, somewhat limiting the range of options at your disposal. Picture and picture and chroma key features can partially make up for this limitation, along with animated subtitles and great transitions that add some extra oomph to the final product.

### 6 [Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram/id712908978)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram.jpg)

You can do a lot of different things with this video editing app, although it’s best suited for the creation of Instagram videos. The free version is available for both major OS platforms, but in order to use full features on your iPhone, you might need to make a $0.99 in-app purchase. The app lets you combine photos and videos, and place them into one of many predefined and fully adjustable split screen frames and collage formats. However, this app works best with clips made from your own phone and may not be the best choice if you need to import multimedia from diverse sources. Considering that most social media users these days shoot and edit their clips in the same breath, Vidstitch Frames could be sufficiently advanced for their needs.

### 7\. [Acapella](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acapella-from-picplaypost/id924635678)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Acapella](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/acapella-from-picplaypost.jpg)

While this is primarily a music editing app, it can also be used with reasonable success for creating and sharing videos. Most importantly, it supports multi-frame layouts and allows you to combine several video clips to accompany the multi-track sound. Various frames and backgrounds are available to use as plug-and-play elements while you are making a new split screen video. The songs and videos you can record with Acapella are limited to 10 minutes in duration, although this should be more than enough for all except the most ambitious users. On the other hand, demanding users who primarily want to edit videos rather than music can probably find a better split screen app.

### 8\. [Video Merge, Side by Side](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.irisstudio.videomerge&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Merge, Side by Side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-merge-side-by-side.jpg)

Installing this Android app will instantly enable you to create unique videos by merging two different clips into one. The app shows both streams together and can place them side by side or one atop of another, depending on user preference. This is a great way to show two different shots of the same event or summarize the footage from your travels without spending a ton of time. While the app is very intuitive and easy to learn, it can’t work with more than two video sources and it sorely lacks some of the more sophisticated features that a premium split screen video editor should have.

### 9\. [4xcamera](https://www.roland.com/us/products/4xcamera/)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

As its name implies, 4Xcamera can handle up to four independent inputs containing both video and audio components. As such, it can be a powerful tool for recording live music performances and editing the footage to get amazing multi-screen music videos. Each of the performers can be in a separate location, but this split screen app allows for simultaneous recording and real-time playback in a very effortless fashion. Three aspect ratios are supported (1:1, 9:16, and 16:9), along with 10 unique split screen patterns for each of those formats. The free version is available from the App Store as well as Google Play, although paid features might be necessary for the best possible results.

### 10\. [Multiple Videos at Same Time](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.badongutech.playvideos4fun&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

This practical and intuitive split screen software can play up to four different videos at the same time, albeit only in the basic layout with four equally sized fields. It is best suited for playback rather than video editing, and most of the options are basic viewing-related commands such as rewinding, searching, or volume control. On a more positive note, this app can be easily connected to a large screen TV or a movie projector and used for multi-screen promotions and presentations. The app has minimal hardware requirements and is extremely easy to use, even for a person with no experience in multimedia production. It’s fair to say that the app has a clearly defined target group and serves well in its primary role, but it doesn’t compare favorably with some of the general purpose editors presented earlier.

**Conclusion**

The field is quite broad when it comes to split screen video apps, with numerous high-quality products available for free or at a low cost. The most optimal choice of editing software depends on numerous factors, including the level of experience and the purpose of the videos. With so many options to choose from, every advanced social media user can create brilliant videos that combine multiple sources and create a dynamic, modern format. It takes some practice to master the split screen tool and get the layout just right without overwhelming the viewer, but this is easier to achieve when you have professional-level editing tools installed on your smartphone.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

This is Apple’s own video app and it is generally regarded as one of the better in its class, especially considering it’s free to download. The app allows users to shoot, edit, and publish their videos and basically acts as a full-scale portable production studio capable of creating professional-looking movie trailers or even short films. Among the numerous advanced features, iMovie supports split-screen and picture-in-picture options, while also making it very simple to add titles or credits in a wide variety of styles. Because of this, it can be sufficient for anyone whose editing needs are not too complex. Even professional users can start working in iMovie before switching to a more robust Apple editing tool such as Final Cut Pro X.

### 2\. [PicPlay Post Movie Video Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flambestudios.picplaypost&hl=en)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - PicPlayPost ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-movie-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile tool can be used to create and edit video clips or photo collages with a broad range of eye-catching features. It supports the split screen option with up to 9 tiles organized in a 3 x 3 pattern, and offers a lot of pre-defined backgrounds and layouts. Most importantly, you can choose between 9:16 and 16:9 aspect ratios, so the outgoing clips are ready for sharing on any social media platform in landscape or portrait orientation. It’s perfect for creating simple side-by-side comparisons as well as more complex collages that consist of still photos, GIFs, and video clips. The app is easy to use and requires very little training to achieve spectacular results.

### 3\. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-collage-and-photo-grid/id779353036)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Collage and Photo Grid ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

The advantage of any specialized app is that it can perform the chosen function very well, and in the case of a video collage app that means a lot of split screen presets and customization opportunities. You can choose from 64 different layouts featuring up to four videos that can play at the same time. All layouts can be manually adjusted to get the best possible fit with your content, while frame textures can be changed as well. The resulting video collage can be combined with music for a true multimedia feel. Instant preview is a very useful feature as well since it allows the authors to experiment freely while they are searching for the perfect layout of the screen.

### 4\. [Split Screen Video](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/split-screen-videos/id1141913470#?platform=iphone)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** $2.99

![Split Screen Video Making App -Split Screen Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-videos-app.jpg)

With this simple digital tool, you can easily combine from two to four videos into a great, dynamic clip. This is an Apple-only application and has a modest price considering the range of its features. Videos can be placed into frames, and their size and style can be adjusted at will so that some tiles are larger than others. For those who enjoy speed and convenience, there are six preset layouts that can be used to quickly put together a stunning split screen video. Since the interface is extremely user-friendly, this can take as little as a few minutes to execute.

### 5\. [Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/perfect-video-editor-collage/id633335631)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perfect-video-editor-collage.jpg)

There are numerous advantages of this split screen video app, starting from the simplicity of use that makes it ideal for beginners and casual users. Perfect Video Editor supports practically every aspect ratio you can think of, so it works well as a universal editing tool regardless of the intended use of the video. The split screen feature is sadly limited to just two video channels, somewhat limiting the range of options at your disposal. Picture and picture and chroma key features can partially make up for this limitation, along with animated subtitles and great transitions that add some extra oomph to the final product.

### 6 [Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram/id712908978)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram.jpg)

You can do a lot of different things with this video editing app, although it’s best suited for the creation of Instagram videos. The free version is available for both major OS platforms, but in order to use full features on your iPhone, you might need to make a $0.99 in-app purchase. The app lets you combine photos and videos, and place them into one of many predefined and fully adjustable split screen frames and collage formats. However, this app works best with clips made from your own phone and may not be the best choice if you need to import multimedia from diverse sources. Considering that most social media users these days shoot and edit their clips in the same breath, Vidstitch Frames could be sufficiently advanced for their needs.

### 7\. [Acapella](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acapella-from-picplaypost/id924635678)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Acapella](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/acapella-from-picplaypost.jpg)

While this is primarily a music editing app, it can also be used with reasonable success for creating and sharing videos. Most importantly, it supports multi-frame layouts and allows you to combine several video clips to accompany the multi-track sound. Various frames and backgrounds are available to use as plug-and-play elements while you are making a new split screen video. The songs and videos you can record with Acapella are limited to 10 minutes in duration, although this should be more than enough for all except the most ambitious users. On the other hand, demanding users who primarily want to edit videos rather than music can probably find a better split screen app.

### 8\. [Video Merge, Side by Side](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.irisstudio.videomerge&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Merge, Side by Side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-merge-side-by-side.jpg)

Installing this Android app will instantly enable you to create unique videos by merging two different clips into one. The app shows both streams together and can place them side by side or one atop of another, depending on user preference. This is a great way to show two different shots of the same event or summarize the footage from your travels without spending a ton of time. While the app is very intuitive and easy to learn, it can’t work with more than two video sources and it sorely lacks some of the more sophisticated features that a premium split screen video editor should have.

### 9\. [4xcamera](https://www.roland.com/us/products/4xcamera/)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

As its name implies, 4Xcamera can handle up to four independent inputs containing both video and audio components. As such, it can be a powerful tool for recording live music performances and editing the footage to get amazing multi-screen music videos. Each of the performers can be in a separate location, but this split screen app allows for simultaneous recording and real-time playback in a very effortless fashion. Three aspect ratios are supported (1:1, 9:16, and 16:9), along with 10 unique split screen patterns for each of those formats. The free version is available from the App Store as well as Google Play, although paid features might be necessary for the best possible results.

### 10\. [Multiple Videos at Same Time](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.badongutech.playvideos4fun&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

This practical and intuitive split screen software can play up to four different videos at the same time, albeit only in the basic layout with four equally sized fields. It is best suited for playback rather than video editing, and most of the options are basic viewing-related commands such as rewinding, searching, or volume control. On a more positive note, this app can be easily connected to a large screen TV or a movie projector and used for multi-screen promotions and presentations. The app has minimal hardware requirements and is extremely easy to use, even for a person with no experience in multimedia production. It’s fair to say that the app has a clearly defined target group and serves well in its primary role, but it doesn’t compare favorably with some of the general purpose editors presented earlier.

**Conclusion**

The field is quite broad when it comes to split screen video apps, with numerous high-quality products available for free or at a low cost. The most optimal choice of editing software depends on numerous factors, including the level of experience and the purpose of the videos. With so many options to choose from, every advanced social media user can create brilliant videos that combine multiple sources and create a dynamic, modern format. It takes some practice to master the split screen tool and get the layout just right without overwhelming the viewer, but this is easier to achieve when you have professional-level editing tools installed on your smartphone.

## Minimum system requirement to run Premiere Pro on Windows and Mac in 2019

Your computer should at least to meet **the minimum specification** below to run Premiere Pro, and if you need to edit some VR videos, your computer configuration should be higher according to [the minimum specifications list on their website](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html).

* Intel 6th or newer **CPU**
* Windows 10 (64-bit) 1703 or later/ MacOS V10.12 later
* **16GB RAM**; 4GB GPU VRAM
* Fast internal SSD
* 1920\*1080 **Display resolution**
* 32-bit **video card**
* **Internet connection**

However, it is important to remember this is the minimum specification, and will not necessarily give a satisfactory user experience. The recommended specifications are far more likely to provide the kind of performance expected of the software and those would be the ones to use as a guide for the minimum spec for a new computer or any upgrades being planned prior to installation.

## How to check Computer Specifications

Since Premiere Pro CC only works on Windows 10 system after 2018 13.0 release, we will show you how to check if your PC meets the requirements to run Premiere Pro on Windows 10

* Press **Windows Key+ E** on the keyboard to bring up **Windows Explorer**.
* Right click the **This PC** option in the sidebar and then select **Properties** from the context menu.

![check PC system](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/check-system-requirements.jpg)

* The system specification window will show up which you see the **Processor**, RAM, system type and other system information.

Checking the specification on your Mac is easy, just click the **Apple icon** in the top-left corner of your Mac, and then select **About This Mac** option. In the pop-up window you will see the information including Processor speed, memory and graphic card etc.

## How to Set Up Computer for Premiere

#### 1\. Processor

Whilst the software will run on a Core2Duo intel or Phenom II AMD processor, it is worth noting that [rendering can be highly intensive work for the processor](https://www.cgdirector.com/best-cpu-for-rendering/) and the fastest possible processor within your budget will pay dividends in speed of editing. In general, even a Core I3, the cheapest of the current Intel range, will be significantly faster than older processors, but because Premiere happily uses multi cored processors to their full, if the budget can reach to a quad core or more processor then do so, Premiere is a piece of software that benefits from the computational power increase more than most.

#### 2\. Memory

The next consideration is memory. The minimum specification suggests 4GB of RAM with 8GB recommended, for reliable and smooth running consider 8GB minimum, and go for as much as you can. For a computer that is used for other activities as well, multitasking can see even 24GB of Ram being fully utilized, especially if you are working on HD content. Speaking of content, this is the other aspect of memory to look at. Whilst you can use a storage drive that contains everything else on your computer to keep the media you are working on, for HD content especially, and for trouble free and the fastest possible operation it is advisable to reserve a single drive, preferably a 7200 RPM or faster one, exclusively for your media. Bandwidth and access times means Premiere will be significantly faster in operation with its media on a dedicated drive.

#### 3\. Graphic

The final aspect of specification to consider is graphics. Adobe Premiere uses a feature called the Mercury Playback Engine that allows much faster and smoother playback of video without rendering, it has two modes, software only and [GPU acceleration mode](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32876/gpu-accelerated-computing) (Using either CUDA or OpenCL). The GPU acceleration mode offers significant performance increases and is therefore highly desirable. However, not all GPU's are compatible with the Mercury Playback Engine, the list of those that are is found on the previously linked specification page, so if a new computer is being built or purchased, or upgrades are being considered prior to install, it is highly desirable to utilize a compatible GPU where possible.

#### 5\. Settings

Having covered the basic specifications of a computer that will enhance the operation of Premiere, it is now time to look at the computer settings and how this can affect Premiere's performance and usability.

The first thing to understand is that video editing, especially HD video, is bandwidth intensive, in effect, it fills up the lanes between the CPU, RAM, GPU and Hard Drive during operation. Spreading the use of that bandwidth over several devices can see huge performance gains, so one of the best ways to optimize the computer for Premier is to adjust how the hard drives are used. How effective this can be depends on the computer you are using, so we will try to cover a few different possibilities here.

#### 6\. Drive

If your computer contains a single drive, simply install Premiere and start using it, there are no options available here. If there are two drives, keep one for the operating system, programs and cache files. Use the second drive exclusively for video project files, exported projects and previews.

If the computer has three drives then keep one for the operating system and programs, the second one for the video project files, and use the third for previews, cache files and exported projects.

If you have access to even more drives, then split the cache from the previews, and ultimately have one drive each for previews, exports and cache. Spreading the files across as many drives as possible enhances performance by enabling the different read/write operations to occur without interference from each other.

That is the theory, but how do you achieve this? This is done within Premiere itself, there are two parts, accessing where the media cache files are placed is done though the edit menu, following the path edit > preferences > media.

![adobe premiere requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-1.png "adobe premiere requirements")

Changing where the project files, previews and exports are stored is just as easy, and is accessed via the project menu by taking the path project > project settings > scratchdisks.

![adobe premiere requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-2.png "adobe premiere requirements")

#### 7\. Sequence Setting

When working with Premiere it is important to have the correct settings for the type of media you are using and the nature of the final output. This is done within Premiere by a function known as a Sequence.

After creating a new project you are presented with the sequence dialogue box. You can have as many sequences in a single project as you like, but Premiere always assumes you require at least one and so needs the first one to be created to allow work on a project. Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.

The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks

The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.

![adobe premiere requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-3.png "adobe premiere requirements")

Once the preset is chosen you can move to the settings tab to adjust the preset manually. Some settings will not be adjustable in this tab due to the specific optimization required for the input media.

Because the presets do such a good job it is not really necessary to adjust anything in the settings tab, and unless you are trying to do something very specific.

While the standard presets are usually suitable, on occasion you may desire a custom setting. To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.

Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.

## Conclusion

If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isn’t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.

## How to Set Up Computer for Premiere

#### 1\. Processor

Whilst the software will run on a Core2Duo intel or Phenom II AMD processor, it is worth noting that [rendering can be highly intensive work for the processor](https://www.cgdirector.com/best-cpu-for-rendering/) and the fastest possible processor within your budget will pay dividends in speed of editing. In general, even a Core I3, the cheapest of the current Intel range, will be significantly faster than older processors, but because Premiere happily uses multi cored processors to their full, if the budget can reach to a quad core or more processor then do so, Premiere is a piece of software that benefits from the computational power increase more than most.

#### 2\. Memory

The next consideration is memory. The minimum specification suggests 4GB of RAM with 8GB recommended, for reliable and smooth running consider 8GB minimum, and go for as much as you can. For a computer that is used for other activities as well, multitasking can see even 24GB of Ram being fully utilized, especially if you are working on HD content. Speaking of content, this is the other aspect of memory to look at. Whilst you can use a storage drive that contains everything else on your computer to keep the media you are working on, for HD content especially, and for trouble free and the fastest possible operation it is advisable to reserve a single drive, preferably a 7200 RPM or faster one, exclusively for your media. Bandwidth and access times means Premiere will be significantly faster in operation with its media on a dedicated drive.

#### 3\. Graphic

The final aspect of specification to consider is graphics. Adobe Premiere uses a feature called the Mercury Playback Engine that allows much faster and smoother playback of video without rendering, it has two modes, software only and [GPU acceleration mode](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32876/gpu-accelerated-computing) (Using either CUDA or OpenCL). The GPU acceleration mode offers significant performance increases and is therefore highly desirable. However, not all GPU's are compatible with the Mercury Playback Engine, the list of those that are is found on the previously linked specification page, so if a new computer is being built or purchased, or upgrades are being considered prior to install, it is highly desirable to utilize a compatible GPU where possible.

#### 5\. Settings

Having covered the basic specifications of a computer that will enhance the operation of Premiere, it is now time to look at the computer settings and how this can affect Premiere's performance and usability.

The first thing to understand is that video editing, especially HD video, is bandwidth intensive, in effect, it fills up the lanes between the CPU, RAM, GPU and Hard Drive during operation. Spreading the use of that bandwidth over several devices can see huge performance gains, so one of the best ways to optimize the computer for Premier is to adjust how the hard drives are used. How effective this can be depends on the computer you are using, so we will try to cover a few different possibilities here.

#### 6\. Drive

If your computer contains a single drive, simply install Premiere and start using it, there are no options available here. If there are two drives, keep one for the operating system, programs and cache files. Use the second drive exclusively for video project files, exported projects and previews.

If the computer has three drives then keep one for the operating system and programs, the second one for the video project files, and use the third for previews, cache files and exported projects.

If you have access to even more drives, then split the cache from the previews, and ultimately have one drive each for previews, exports and cache. Spreading the files across as many drives as possible enhances performance by enabling the different read/write operations to occur without interference from each other.

That is the theory, but how do you achieve this? This is done within Premiere itself, there are two parts, accessing where the media cache files are placed is done though the edit menu, following the path edit > preferences > media.

![adobe premiere requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-1.png "adobe premiere requirements")

Changing where the project files, previews and exports are stored is just as easy, and is accessed via the project menu by taking the path project > project settings > scratchdisks.

![adobe premiere requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-2.png "adobe premiere requirements")

#### 7\. Sequence Setting

When working with Premiere it is important to have the correct settings for the type of media you are using and the nature of the final output. This is done within Premiere by a function known as a Sequence.

After creating a new project you are presented with the sequence dialogue box. You can have as many sequences in a single project as you like, but Premiere always assumes you require at least one and so needs the first one to be created to allow work on a project. Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.

The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks

The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.

![adobe premiere requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-3.png "adobe premiere requirements")

Once the preset is chosen you can move to the settings tab to adjust the preset manually. Some settings will not be adjustable in this tab due to the specific optimization required for the input media.

Because the presets do such a good job it is not really necessary to adjust anything in the settings tab, and unless you are trying to do something very specific.

While the standard presets are usually suitable, on occasion you may desire a custom setting. To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.

Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.

## Conclusion

If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isn’t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.
