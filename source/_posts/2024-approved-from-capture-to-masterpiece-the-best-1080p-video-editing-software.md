## Section 3. Advance Editing tips for Gopro Video on Filmora

If you want to add even more pizzazz to your videos, then why not look into other powerful features like motion tracking, color match, and audio ducking? They may sound complicated, but in reality, they’re easy to use.

#### 1\. Motion Tracking

his feature lets you track objects in your videos so that other objects can move along with them. If you have a video in which you want to make it look like you have wings and you’re flying, then you can align the movement of the wings with the movement of your body using the motion tracking feature. Here are the steps you need to take to track objects:

**Step 1**. Double-click the video in the timeline and then check the Motion Tracking box.

![motion track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/32.motion-track.jpg)

**Step 2**. Place the Target Box over the object you want to track and click Start Tracking.

![box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/32.box.jpg)

**Step 3**. Select the media that you want to move with the tracked object. Remember that this media already has to be in the timeline.

![start tracking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/32.start-tracking.jpg)

**Step 4**. Adjust the size or position of whatever media you selected in the previous step.

#### 2\. Color Match

Wondershare video editor for Mac also lets you color correct multiple videos as a batch. If you have videos that have similar lighting and you want to change their colors quickly to make them consistent, then you should use color match. Here’s how you can use it:

**Step 1**. Color correct one video in the timeline like how you’d typically color correct any other video.

![color match](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/34.color-match.jpg)

**Step 2**. Place the playback line on the video you color corrected and then select the other videos you want to color correct.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/34.done.jpg)

**Step 3**. On the toolbar, click the color icon, and a drop-down menu will appear from which you’ll have to click on Color Match. After a new window opens, you can adjust the level of color correction however, you wish.

![done](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/34.done.jpg)

If you feel the colors don’t match, you can open the Comparison Preview and use the slider to adjust the colors.

#### 3\. Audio Ducking

If you want to temporarily reduce one audio track volume so that another is more audible, use audio ducking. You can use it in videos where you want to decrease the volume of music when someone starts speaking to hear them better. Here are the steps:

**Step 1**. Select the audio track you want to make more audible.

**Step 2**. Right-click on it and click on Adjust Audio.

![ajust audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/8.ajust-audio.jpg)

**Step 3**. Check the “lower the volume of other clips” box.

![audio ducking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/8.audio-ducking.jpg)

**Step 4**. Once you press OK, the volume of every other audio track will be lowered. You can adjust the ducking level to achieve your desired effect.

Mastering these three features will make your videos stand out, so spend some time playing around with them.

## Section 2. Basic Editing Tips for Gopro Video on Filmora

Now that you’ve imported your videos, it’s time to edit Gopro video with Filmora X. Filmora X video editor makes editing not only easy but also fun. Here are some of its features: splitting videos, resizing images, and combining video clips. You can also add effects, stickers, audio, titles, and split screens.

#### 1\. Effects - Filters and Overlays

Want to give your videos a vintage look? You can do that by adding filters and overlays! Simply click on the Effects tab and select whichever filter or overlay you want to add to your video. Adding new layers using overlays is a great way to give your videos a new look.

![filter 9 mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filter-9-mac.jpg)

* In order to make your videos look smooth, you can switch to the Transition tab and select the transition you want to use and then drag and drop it in the timeline between the two videos.

#### 3\. Split Screen and Audio

Split Screen is a powerful feature that allows you to edit multiple videos in two or more segments. You might need it if you’re editing videos that show the same scene from different angles. On Filmora, there are over thirty layouts that let you add six different videos.
