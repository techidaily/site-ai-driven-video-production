Here's how you can use it. You need to visit the official website and upload the audio file, MP3, or WAV that you want to edit. After that, you need to apply an audio visualizer. You can add background and effects, too, if you wish. After you are all done, export your video.

## Part 3: Why Should You Use Audio Visualization?

Audio entertainment has been around since time immemorial, and there's no doubt about how big of an impact it has. However, when you add audio visualization, it enhances the listening experience by manifolds. Take podcasts, for example. They have become extremely popular.

In fact, there are currently more than 30 million podcast episodes running across the world. But when you combine audio visualization, it makes the audio even better. It becomes more engaging. Not that it sounds stand-alone can't have an impact on the audience, but with audio visualization, it doubles itself when it comes to engagement and creating a lasting impression.

**Conclusion**

So, now you know about the top **audio waveform video generators.** You can choose one from the list we have mentioned and get started because your audios, such as lyrical music videos and podcasts, deserve the magical touch of an audio visualization. So, don't miss out on it, and try an audio waveform generator today.
