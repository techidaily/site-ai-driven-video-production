When you’re an amateur filmmaker, then it’s essential to have affordable options for filmmaking software that can help you to achieve your goals. But, what types of options do you have that are going to fit in your budget? In this article, we’ll give you 7 different options for low-budget filmmaking software.

* [**Part 1: Film Editing Software to Edit Videos**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Filmmaking Software to Improve Workflow**](#part2)

## 6 Filmmaking Software You Need to Know

## Part 1: Film Editing Software to Edit Videos

### 1. [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora - a video editor which has significantly improved overall performance, making the product faster, and more powerful, and taking the user editing experience to a new level.

It is perfect for helping beginners, and intermediate users create stylish videos by providing an intuitive user interface and built-in effects.

### 2. [Vegas Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/)

Vegas Pro is one of the most well-known budget options out there when it comes to video editing. It actually started out as editing software for audio (podcasts, radio shows, etc.), but then expanded over time. Because of those beginnings, many people have found that it is one of the best options you’ll have available when it comes to audio editing within a film. It’s also very versatile – you don’t need anything but a Windows PC in order to run it.

![Vegas Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-vegas-pro.jpg)

## Part 2: Filmmaking Software to Improve Workflow

### 2. [StudioBinder](https://www.studiobinder.com/script-sides/)

Keeping up with the production process takes a lot of work, and Studio Binder was specially designed to help you take care of those things more easily. From script breakdowns (which keep everyone in the loop as to what is next in filming) to lists where you keep track of what shots you’ve taken and which you need to take, it has everything you need to keep your entire team on track throughout the entire process of filming.

![StudioBinder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/StudioBinder.jpg)

### 3. [Storyboarder](https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/)

Keeping up with the story and everything around it during the filming process can take a lot of work. That’s why many filmmakers suggest putting together what is known as a storyboard – a rough draft of the storyline, put together in a fashion so that you can follow everything and check it all out properly. Storyboarder is a software package that helps you to visualize everything, check out if the story works, and keep up with your ideas (even if you get distracted during filming).

![Storyboarder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Storyboarder.jpg)

### 4. [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)

Sometimes, you need something that is a little more advanced and focused when it comes to putting together the sound mix in a way that is pleasing to the ears. Adobe Audition is one of the most popular options for this, because it has all of the tools necessary so that you can get the perfect balance and fullness of sound in your film. Your sound is just as important as your videography, so picking this up can be really helpful in the long run.

![Adobe Audition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audition.jpg)

### 5. [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)

Organization is absolutely essential when you’re trying to put a film together and, because of that, you’re likely exploring a lot of different options that can help you to stay organized. Evernote is a lovely option and it’s available for computers and for phones/tablets, so you can take it anywhere with you. You can put together task lists, keep notes on what’s going on during the filming process, and more. It’s a really simple program to use and it’s quite easy to import and export info from it.

![Evernote](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Evernote.jpg)

### 6. [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)

Google Docs is part of the Google Suite, and it’s a smart word processing program that has all of the flexibility of programs like Microsoft Word. One of the biggest differences, however, is the ability to collaborate and work on the same document without the need to send it back and forth via email. Changes are updated in real time, so you can work on a document together, even if you aren’t in the same vicinity.

![Google Docs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Google-Docs.jpg)

## Conclusion

Do some research on the web and find the options that work best for your team’s budget and for how you plan on working on your films. You can find plenty of low-budget software that can help to make your film look great without breaking the budget you’ve set into place.

## Part 2: Most Easy and Creative Features in Filmora (You Should Definitely Try)

Now you have the **Filmora free** version on your device. That means that you have now successfully gained access to multiple features of Wondershare Filmora for free. Filmora offers its users several unique and creative features that can be used to make your videos top-notch. Mastering these tools requires lots of practice, but the end result is definitely worth it all.

There are various tools offered by Filmora that can help elevate the rank of your videos to make them top-tier, but they are often overlooked. Users generally do not have an idea of how to make the most out of their tool. Here, we have mentioned some of the fun and easy-to-use features offered by Filmora that you should definitely try as an aspiring content creator.

### 1. Filmora Green Screen

The Green Screen effect by Filmora is an advanced feature of the Overlays option. It enables users to combine two overlaid clips in such a way that the background of the lower layer can be visible on the top layer. It uses a color range in the top clip to make it shine through. You can get this effect by using a green background while shooting videos.
