## Part 1 The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Learn about YouTube to MP4 Video Converter

### 01**What is the MP4 format?**

![mp4 format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/solution-for-choosing-fast-youtube-to-mp4-video-converter-02.jpg)

MP4 files were executed under the ISO/IEC 14496-12:2001 standard by the IEC/ISO and Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG). MP4 is an international specification for audio-visual coding only because of this.

The high degree of compression used in MP4 videos assists the files to be much smaller in size than other video formats. Minimizing the file size doesn't suddenly affect the file quality, either. Almost the entire original quality retains, making MP4 a web-friendly and portable video format.

They shouldn't be confused with M4A and MP3, while MP4 files can play audio.

It can also help to store the other kinds of data files, such as different subtitles and still images.

This media container allows a blend of video, audio, subtitles, and still images to be present only in a single file. It also assists in storing advanced content like 3D Graphics, interactivity of the menus, and the users. This tool is highly accessible, and everyone can use it with simplicity.

### 02**Pros and Cons of the MP4 format**

**Pros of the MP4 format**

One of the critical merits of the MP4 format is that it can be valuable on different platforms.

**●** It consists of a high degree of compression while producing smaller file sizes, making it a perfect fit for compressing or video streaming HD audio-video files.

**●** An MP4 file can contain metadata and Extensible Meta Data Platform such as images based on PNG or JPEG format, subtitles, among others, and PDF.

**●** Compatible with metadata integrable with 3D graphics, user navigation or menus options, and other user interaction features.

**●** There are numerous open-source players, such as VLC Media Player, that offer full format support, even used on Linux OS.

**●** It is also versatile. For example, audio files coded with the M4A extension and MPEG-4 visual bitstreams encoded in the M4V extension.

**Cons of the MP4 format**

Note that the format is a container. This means that instead of storing the ode for the file, it keeps the data. Moreover, a specific MP4 file is based upon particular codecs because it does not have a native way of managing the involved coding.

A possible drawback is that there are hundreds of codecs available. Therefore, a media player must run a set of codecs concerning a particular MP4 file.

Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.

**●** Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.

**●** Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.

**●** It is still a lossy format. A higher compression format and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality losses.

**●** The familiarity of the MP4 format, coupled with its portability, has also enabled the illegal distribution of copyrighted audio-video files.

### 03**Is it possible to convert videos to MP4 without any software?**

### 01**What is the MP4 format?**

![mp4 format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/solution-for-choosing-fast-youtube-to-mp4-video-converter-02.jpg)

MP4 files were executed under the ISO/IEC 14496-12:2001 standard by the IEC/ISO and Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG). MP4 is an international specification for audio-visual coding only because of this.

The high degree of compression used in MP4 videos assists the files to be much smaller in size than other video formats. Minimizing the file size doesn't suddenly affect the file quality, either. Almost the entire original quality retains, making MP4 a web-friendly and portable video format.

They shouldn't be confused with M4A and MP3, while MP4 files can play audio.

### 02**Pros and Cons of the MP4 format**

**Pros of the MP4 format**

One of the critical merits of the MP4 format is that it can be valuable on different platforms.

**●** It consists of a high degree of compression while producing smaller file sizes, making it a perfect fit for compressing or video streaming HD audio-video files.

**●** An MP4 file can contain metadata and Extensible Meta Data Platform such as images based on PNG or JPEG format, subtitles, among others, and PDF.

**●** Compatible with metadata integrable with 3D graphics, user navigation or menus options, and other user interaction features.

**●** There are numerous open-source players, such as VLC Media Player, that offer full format support, even used on Linux OS.

**●** It is also versatile. For example, audio files coded with the M4A extension and MPEG-4 visual bitstreams encoded in the M4V extension.

**Cons of the MP4 format**

Note that the format is a container. This means that instead of storing the ode for the file, it keeps the data. Moreover, a specific MP4 file is based upon particular codecs because it does not have a native way of managing the involved coding.

A possible drawback is that there are hundreds of codecs available. Therefore, a media player must run a set of codecs concerning a particular MP4 file.

Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.

**●** Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.

**●** Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.

**●** It is still a lossy format. A higher compression format and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality losses.

**●** The familiarity of the MP4 format, coupled with its portability, has also enabled the illegal distribution of copyrighted audio-video files.

Wondershare Filmora is one of the most popular and advanced video editing tools of the present time, and it certainly needs no introduction. The video editor is available for Windows and Mac and is already used by millions of people worldwide.

The best part is that while buying your subscription, you can apply a Filmora discount code to get a substantial off. After all, who doesn’t like discounts, right? To protect you from the growing fake discount codes and gimmicks, I have listed 5 trusted and genuine ways to get a discount on the purchase of Wondershare Filmora in this official guide.

## Method 1: Use the Filmora Discount Coupon for Students

To encourage the use of its utility products in education, Wondershare offers numerous coupon codes on its flagship products for students. Therefore, to get an instant Filmora discount code, you can simply use your Students Beans ID for making the purchase. As of now, students can avail up to 30% off on their purchase of a Filmora subscription.

To get this Filmora discount coupon, you can just go to the official website of Filmora and click on the “Buy Now” button. Now, from the available options, you can just go to the “Educational” tab.

Here, you can fill a form with details about your school and the intent of using Wondershare Filmora. Simply submit the required information and wait for a correspondence email from Filmora with your discount details.

You can get a monthly, annual, or perpetual license of Filmora. While the annual license will have a discount of 20%, the perpetual license will let you buy Filmora for 30% off. Wondershare also gives us the freedom to cancel our subscription whenever we want.

## Method 2: Subscribe to Filmora’s Mailing List to Get Regular Discounts

If you want to get regular updates regarding Wondershare Filmora, then you can also subscribe to its mailing list. All you need to do is go to the official website of Filmora and enter your valid email ID to its subscription list.

That’s it! You are now a part of its subscription list and would get timely emails about Filmora discount codes, release updates, and other details about the product. Just keep an eye on any new email from Filmora and make sure that you check the “Promotions” tab on your Gmail Inbox to avoid missing out on any Filmora promo code.

## Method 3: Check Festive and Special Occasion Discounts

Wondershare Filmora keeps coming up with all kinds of discounts and promotional events every once in a while. For instance, Wondershare is known for hosting a tempting Black Friday Sale every year that you should not miss.

Apart from that, there are also sales on other occasions like Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, New Year, and so on. You can keep checking the official website of Wondershare Filmora during any special occasion to avail these limited discounts.

(Please note that all these prices are for the annual subscription of these products)
