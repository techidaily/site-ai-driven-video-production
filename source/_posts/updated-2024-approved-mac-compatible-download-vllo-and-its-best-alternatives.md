Exporting a single frame of a video clip is an easy task even amateur photo and video editors can perform effortlessly.

To extract still images with the original high quality, you can import and place these videos to Project Media and then double-click it to preview. In the preview window, click the Camera icon located in the lower right corner to take a snapshot. It is worth noting that you can only create PNG files with this video editing software, and you may need to change the photo format if PNG isn’t your choice.

![Extract PNG Image from Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/take-snapchat-9.jpg)

Alternatively, you can use the CTRL+ALT+S keyboard shortcut to take a snapshot of the frame in a video clip. The image you created will be added to the Media tab automatically, and you can proceed to right-click on it and select the Reveal in Explorer option to gain access to the original file.

Since you’re here, you probably look for such a magic video maker that make magical videos like this:

#### 1 Import your media files

The magic media maker provides a User's Album to manage your source files, and keep them intact for convenient access. To import your videos, audio or images to this program, simply click "Import" to browse your file folder or drag them directly to the primary window.

All imported files will show as thumbnails in the left pane. When they come into place, drag and drop these files to their corresponding Timeline.

#### 2 Create your own masterpiece with handy tools

Now, go ahead to edit and personalize your videos. With comfortable Timeline-based editing and comprehensive drag-n-drop feature, you'll find it easier than ever to get started in the world of video editing. The most important: this application features everything you need.

**Basic Edit:** Double click a video clip on the Timeline to pop up the editing panel. Here, you can rotate, crop, adjust brightness, contrast, saturation in the video pane, or change volume, pitch, set fade in/fade out effect in the audio pane. Apart from this, you can do cutting, copying, splitting, removing audio, etc. by a right menu click.

**Add Elements:**  Adding elements like smooth transitions and colorful visual filters will polish your video instantly. And this magic video editor can do this by simple drag-n-drop. Click "Text", " Effect", "PIP", "Transition", "Intro/Credit", or "Sound" tab above the Timeline, you'll see hundreds of free templates available to touch up your videos. Just pick your favorite one and drag them to the position to apply. When it comes into place, you can even adjust the play duration and set animation to achieve more.

**Advanced Edit:** The advanced editing for this Magic movie editor refers to the professional video editing tools like [tilt-shift](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [mosaic](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), jump cut, [face-off](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and flash-n-hold that makes your video extraordinary. To do this, just click the "Power Tools" icon above the Timeline, and you'll come to a window that helps you complete all the above effect in a click.
