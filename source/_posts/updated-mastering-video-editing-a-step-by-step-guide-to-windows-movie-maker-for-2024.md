**Price**: FREE

Our next **Instagram Video Converter (MP3)** is Ace Thinker. Just like the one from 'Online Video Converter' this is an online solution that you can use on any device (be it your smartphone or Windows/Mac computer). It's also 100% free, so you can use it without having to worry about making any long-term commitments.

| Features                                                                       | Limits                                                                                          |

### 03**Instasaved**

**Price**: FREE

With our next pick, we spice it up with an Instagram-specific tool, called Instasave that you can use to download pretty much any kind of Instagram content that you want. That, of course, includes allowing you to **convert MP3 Instagram** posts! Note, however, this is not as well-known as other options out there, so use it mindfully!

| Features                                                                                                                         | Limits                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Instagram content downloader ● Multiple file format converter ● Online video converter - no download or installation required. | ● Conversion tool only ● No quality control ● Can only be used when online |

### 04**OffMP3**

**Price**: Free

Next on our list is OFFMP3\. It is, much like the other tools we've introduced thus far, an online video converter tool! This one, however, just like Intasaved, is a lot more obscure than the first two that we introduced. And thus, a little more limited.

| Features                                                                  | Limits                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Online video converter ● FREE-to-use ● Multiple video conversion format | ● For online use only ● Obscure site ● Comes with potentially harmful ads |

![OffMP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-8.png)

### 05**4ins**

**Price**: FREE

Despite the name, 4in's Instagram to MP4 converter does work for converting Instagram posts into MP3 files as well (as is shown in the image below). It's not the most advanced converter tool out there. But it does work, and it requires no download or installation.

| Features                                                                                                                 | Limits                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Free to use ● Online video converter, no download or installation needed ● Available conversion formats: .mp4 and .mp3 | ● For online use only ● Limited conversion formats ● No quality control |
