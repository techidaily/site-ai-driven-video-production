##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Although Premiere is a complete and robust platform, there is always room for customization, extras, and just plain cool add-ons that are too niche for Adobe to produce themselves.

For example, you can add [free Adobe Premiere title templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make your video excellent.

While everyone's list will be different depending on what they use Premiere for, here is my choice of tools and effects that I find the most useful.

* [**Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: FAQ about Adobe Premiere Plugins**](#part2)

## Best Alternative to Adobe Premiere - Filmora

The Premiere is excellent if you can find the best Adobe Premiere plugin at the time and money price.

If you want to edit videos easily, here we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is designed for pros who want to make video easily or want to enter a professional video editing level.

For transitions, it has various built-in creative tools to use, including dissolve, motion, zoom, and more. For effects, you can use cinematic effects without efforts.

Unlimited tracks can power up your story with various videos and audio. Free download it to have a try!

Before choosing a plugin, you should consider [compatibility](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/compatibility.html) and [extensibility](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/extensibility.html) in case the plugin is not working with Premiere. You can also visit the Adobe [partner finder database](https://www.adobe.com/partners.html) to have a closer relationship with developers around the world if you want to search for plugin partners

## Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects

#### 1[After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)

Some may say this is cheating, but for me, this is the number one add-on for Premiere. There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.

Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.

Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.

It is the best Adobe Premiere plugins to download.

**Price**: $20.99/month

**Features**

* **Steep learning**: we have to admit that it is not easy to make Adobe Premiere plugins with Effects, but if you have learned how-to, you are the master.
* **Animation**: If you like animation style video, you can use it to make Adobe Premiere animation plugins.

![After Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-1.png)

#### 2[Neat Video](https://www.neatvideo.com/index.html?linkID=p7334)

Neat Video is a great plugin for Premiere, unlike After Effects it has a single function, and that is noise reduction. It is very good at it.

While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.

It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.

Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.

**Price**: $74.9/month

**Features**

* **Underwater shots**: You can make underwater shots with this plug-in. With it, you can make your video more beautiful.
* **Accurate and efficient**: As the best Adobe Premiere plugin, it can offer you an accurate effect.

![free download Neat Video adobe plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-2.png)

#### 3[Final Effects](http://www.borisfx.com/Adobe/fecae/)

A utility box of effects and transitions if ever there was one, Final Effects integrates smoothly with Premiere and includes over 120 different items. If you want to broaden your effects library but do not have any specific requirements, then this is the product for you. I particularly like the 3D relief effect, but there is something in here for every type of project you can think.

**Price**: $2495 for all bundles

**Features**

* **Stylized looks**: it offers various filters to use
* **Auto-animating transitions**: you can make animation style transitions auto.

![Final Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-3.png)

#### 4[Magic Bullet Looks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TG2IG36/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TG2IG36&linkId=40a4862dea2acf5507b237e385f8d55e)

This is a wondrous plugin that is primarily a color finishing tool but includes a raft of options that make it much more useful. The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.

In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.

**Price**: $899

**Features**

* **Great compatibility**: it works well on Windows and Mac.
* **Price**: the price may be higher than we thought.

![download Magic Bullet Looks adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-4.png)

#### 5[Flicker Free](http://digitalanarchy.com/Flicker/main.html)

This one is quite a specific plugin that won't be for everyone, but if you are a regular proponent of time-lapse or slow-motion footage, this is a plugin that will be your best friend for life. One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.

What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.

It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.

**Price**: $79/$99.

**Features**

* **Fluent workflow**: the working experience is great if you try it.
* Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.

![free download Flicker adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-5.png)

#### 6[Damage](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1JPCEW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N1JPCEW&linkId=01542ff77ba269b302237cf03a190f81)

Another great plugin that is very specific in its use, Damage is, despite the name, a non-destructive filter plugin that simulates the grain, glitches, scan lines, and grit of aged film stock. There are over 80 presets available to use, and whilst its use is not going to be hugely widespread, for producing that aged effect there is nothing better.

**Price**: $299

**Features**

* 5 tool kits: it includes 5 Adobe Premiere plug-ins

![Damage adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-6.png)

#### 7[Rays](http://www.digitalfilmtools.com/rays/)

This is a nice plugin that allows the creation of, you've guessed it, Rays. That is light rays to be precise. Atmospheric, beautiful, they can be many things, but there is no questioning the effectiveness of this plugin at simulating light rays. It's outstanding, as this promotional image shows.

Although Premiere is a complete and robust platform, there is always room for customization, extras, and just plain cool add-ons that are too niche for Adobe to produce themselves.

For example, you can add [free Adobe Premiere title templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make your video excellent.

While everyone's list will be different depending on what they use Premiere for, here is my choice of tools and effects that I find the most useful.

* [**Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects**](#part1)

## Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects

#### 1[After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)

Some may say this is cheating, but for me, this is the number one add-on for Premiere. There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.

Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.

Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.

It is the best Adobe Premiere plugins to download.

**Price**: $20.99/month

**Features**

* **Steep learning**: we have to admit that it is not easy to make Adobe Premiere plugins with Effects, but if you have learned how-to, you are the master.
* **Animation**: If you like animation style video, you can use it to make Adobe Premiere animation plugins.

![After Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-1.png)

#### 2[Neat Video](https://www.neatvideo.com/index.html?linkID=p7334)

Neat Video is a great plugin for Premiere, unlike After Effects it has a single function, and that is noise reduction. It is very good at it.

While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.

It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.

Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.

**Price**: $74.9/month

**Features**

* **Underwater shots**: You can make underwater shots with this plug-in. With it, you can make your video more beautiful.
* **Accurate and efficient**: As the best Adobe Premiere plugin, it can offer you an accurate effect.

![free download Neat Video adobe plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-2.png)

#### 3[Final Effects](http://www.borisfx.com/Adobe/fecae/)

A utility box of effects and transitions if ever there was one, Final Effects integrates smoothly with Premiere and includes over 120 different items. If you want to broaden your effects library but do not have any specific requirements, then this is the product for you. I particularly like the 3D relief effect, but there is something in here for every type of project you can think.

**Price**: $2495 for all bundles

**Features**

* **Stylized looks**: it offers various filters to use
* **Auto-animating transitions**: you can make animation style transitions auto.

![Final Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-3.png)

#### 4[Magic Bullet Looks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TG2IG36/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TG2IG36&linkId=40a4862dea2acf5507b237e385f8d55e)

This is a wondrous plugin that is primarily a color finishing tool but includes a raft of options that make it much more useful. The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.

In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.

**Price**: $899

**Features**

* **Great compatibility**: it works well on Windows and Mac.
* **Price**: the price may be higher than we thought.

![download Magic Bullet Looks adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-4.png)

#### 5[Flicker Free](http://digitalanarchy.com/Flicker/main.html)

This one is quite a specific plugin that won't be for everyone, but if you are a regular proponent of time-lapse or slow-motion footage, this is a plugin that will be your best friend for life. One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.

What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.

It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.

**Price**: $79/$99.

**Features**

* **Fluent workflow**: the working experience is great if you try it.
* Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.

Another great plugin that is very specific in its use, Damage is, despite the name, a non-destructive filter plugin that simulates the grain, glitches, scan lines, and grit of aged film stock. There are over 80 presets available to use, and whilst its use is not going to be hugely widespread, for producing that aged effect there is nothing better.

**Price**: $299

**Features**

* 5 tool kits: it includes 5 Adobe Premiere plug-ins

![Damage adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-6.png)

#### 7[Rays](http://www.digitalfilmtools.com/rays/)

This is a nice plugin that allows the creation of, you've guessed it, Rays. That is light rays to be precise. Atmospheric, beautiful, they can be many things, but there is no questioning the effectiveness of this plugin at simulating light rays. It's outstanding, as this promotional image shows.

**Price**: $95

**Features**

* Rays only: if you love rays, this one won't let you regret it.

This is a professional grade package of effects and transitions that raises the bar for what is possible. My favorite one is the tilt-shift that produces that toy-like landscape that has become popular within the photography world in recent years.
