Creating a great soundtrack with Music Video Maker is simple because you can just select a song and cut or trim the parts you don't want to use in the video. The app's video editor lets you apply effects, add frames and text overlays, while you can also import as many as sixty photos from your camera roll and turn them into an HD video.

However, the Music Video Maker is primarily a photo editor, which means that it lacks some of the frequently used effects that are commonly used in music videos that are posted on TikTok and other similar platforms. The app contains ads, which can slow you down during the video editing process. Despite all of these downsides, Music Video Maker app still offers powerful tools that enable its users to create music videos quickly.
