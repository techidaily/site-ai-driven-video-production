Image from the Internet

Transform yourself into a movie star, your favorite singer, or any other famous person in just a few seconds. Using this app is really simple, because you just have to select a picture that contains a face you’d like to use as your own, and the app will automatically make the switch. MixBooth lets you take photos or import images from your photo library or even from your Facebook account. In order to see how the final image is going to look like, you just have to shake your phone, and if you like the result, you can save a photo to your phone or share it on a social media platform of your choice.

**Bonus**

Instead, if you would like to do it on PC, I highly recommend you to watch this clip.
