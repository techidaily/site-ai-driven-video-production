## Recommended 3D animation software - Filmora

It is true that you can make animation on your phone, but editing 3D animation on the desktop is necessary if you want to have more controls on an animation video. Here we recommend using Filmora.

You can use it to make 3D animation or 2D animation by adding [keyframes](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), so the animation will be smooth and natural. You just need to build a white plane to easily start making animation.

Besides, [color correction/grading](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and audio mixer will raise up your animation video to a new level.

Free download it to have a try!

**Note**: The light flare effects of Filmora will make 3D animation to a new level.
