## Unleash Your Creativity: Best Video Editing Apps for Apple Devices

Apple is widely known for its iPhone, iPad, and Macitonsh computer around the world, but do you know that it also provides some fantastic video editing software for creators? In this article, we've compiled a list of the best **Apple** **video** **editing** software on the market right now, including free, freemium, and premium solutions.

With these apps, you can modify videos on your smartphones or computers easily. And if you've invested in an iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max that can capture video in the high-resolution ProRes standard, you'll find reliable software to make the most of your video. We'll go over which applications are excellent for specific chores and provide statistics to help you discover the best match. Let's get started!

## Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try

In today's world, photos and videos are an integral part of everyone's life. Mobile phones, laptops, and cameras may all be used to capture them. But, it might not be easy to organize and decorate them according to one's unique preferences. Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.

In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.

### 1\. Photos

**Supported By:** iOS/macOS/iPadOS

**Pricing:** Free to use

The number one on our list is the Photos app. It's among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.

**What Can You Do with Photos App?**

Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.

Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to **add text**, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can **rotate, crop and auto enhance** videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap **Revert** to restore to the original version.

If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can **adjust the focus points and the depth of the field** in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.

* **Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library**

The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.

* **Moments**

Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo's time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.

* **Themes**

Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.

### 2\. QuickTime Player

**Supported By:** iOS/macOS/iPad

**Pricing:** Free to use

Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that's not to say this one doesn't have excellent features to offer.

**What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?**

* **Trim, Combine,** **Rotate, Split MOV Video**

Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature. Further, you can combine two videos to make one excellent video for your presentation. The app also allows you to split different videos and combine them to produce more quality content.

* **Record Screen and Voiceover**

If you think your video footage can do well with a background voiceover of someone else, QuickTime Player allows you to record your audios in the background while your video plays smoothly. You can also record the desktop screen with the Player.

* **Shrink Video**

If you believe your video looks better with a small size in appearance, try shrinking it using the shrink feature in the QuickTime Player. You can lower the video quality from 1080p, 720p to whatever your phone or Mac storage deems compatible.

### 3\. Clips

**Supported By:** iOS/iPad

**Pricing:** Free to Use

You might not have heard of Clips as much as you may have heard about the others on this list. But don't sleep on this one. Clips have slowly but surely gained the attraction of expert video editors, and you'd see almost all of them having Clips on their iPhones or Macs.

**What Can You Do with Clips?**

Apple Clips is interesting to check out when you're an iOS fan. You can use this free video editing app to record and edit 16:9, 4:3 or square videos with various camera effects, stunning filters, animated text, music, emoji, stickers, and more, and then share it with your friends or family.

* **Family-Oriented**

Apple Clips is mainly oriented towards families and children, and it isn't even close to the capabilities of iMovie. Nonetheless, it is moving closer to be a genuine video editing program with each new version.

* **AR Spaces**

Apple Clips, for instance, introduced AR Spaces, an augmented reality function for iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro owners, in April.

* **Cinematic Mode**

Furthermore, the most recent version in September enables you to import and edit video shot in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 and ProRes footage from the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max.

### 4\. iMovie

**Supported By:** iOS/iPadOS/macOS

**Pricing:** Free to use

One of the most recognizable apps in the Apple market for video editing software is the iMovie app. Almost all professional experts are reaping the benefits of using the iMovie app. The app developers have emphasized greatly equipping the professionals and the newbies who so desperately want to make their mark into the video editing profession.

**What Can You Do with iMovie?**

iMovie, is more like Final Cut Pro X's younger sibling. But it's free with your Mac, so there's no danger in giving it a shot. It's an excellent option for newcomers learning to use editing software, casual enthusiasts, and even YouTubers who wish to cut up their films.

* **Merge, Cut, Trim: Pull off Everything!**

Although iMovie is rather simple, this may be considered a benefit for inexperienced editors. You can combine, cut, and rearrange your original video and audio with iMovie.

* **4K Video Editing**

You may even export your work in 4K quality at up to 60 frames per second once you've done it. Many effects, transitions, filters, and fine-tuning settings for white balance, color matching, and audio isolation are also included.

* **Cinematic Mode**

In September, iMovie received a major upgrade, which included importing and editing footage taken in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 to Macs. You may now add, tweak, and delete focus points, as well as change the depths of field effect in a video shot in Cinematic mode, assuming you have a modern iPhone or iPad.

### 5\. Final Cut Pro

**Supported By:** macOS

**Pricing:** $299.99 for lifetime

Final Cut Pro is worth your attention if you would like a video editing program that you can use even if you may not have much expertise (and you plan on learning as a video editor when using it). It is one of the [best video editing software for professionals](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to use on MacBook or iMac.

**What Can You Do with Final Cut Pro?**

Final Cut Pro is powerful editing software that experts use all over the world. It comes with extra features that are sure to appeal to Mac customers. It may require a few introductory videos to prepare yourself to start doing anything. Still, you can do basic editing and gradually master more complex techniques after you get your toes wet.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files. Which WebM to MP4 converter do you like to use the most? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

Once the playback begins, press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the **Playback** menu from the top, go to **Speed**, and click **Slower (fine)** once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking **Slower (fine)** again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press **Spacebar** again to resume the playback in slow motion.

**Note:** The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.

This means that every time that video is played, the playback speed will remain what you set for it. You must do this for each video in your VLC library individually.

* Launch VLC, and then tap **More** from the bottom-right corner; next, tap **SETTINGS** from the upper-left area;
* Tap **Video** from the **Extra settings** section, and then check the **Save Playback Speed** box

### How to Change VLC Media Player Default Speed on iOS and iPhone

* Tap **Settings** from the Home screen, and then scroll down and tap **VLC**
* Tap **Default playback speed** from the **GENERIC** section, and then tap to select a playback speed from the available list to set it as the default.

**Conclusion**

It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.

## Part 1: How to Play Video in Slow Motion Effects on Windows with VLC?

VLC is one of the [best media players to play videos in slow motion](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can follow the instructions that are given below to learn how to play a video in slow motion in VLC on a Windows PC:

**Step 1: Start Video Playback**

Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click **Media** from the menu bar at the top, click **Open File** from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.

![open file to play slow motion on vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-file-to-play-slow-motion-on-vlc.jpg)

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)**

Once the playback begins, press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the **Playback** menu from the top, go to **Speed**, and click **Slower (fine)** once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking **Slower (fine)** again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press **Spacebar** again to resume the playback in slow motion.

**Note:** The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.

![vlc playback slower slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-playback-slower-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)**

Pause the playback and go to **Playback** \> **Speed** as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click **Slower** (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click **Slower** again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press **Spacebar** to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.

**Note:** You can click **Normal** from the **Speed** submenu to play the video at normal speed.

![play video slow motion on vlc slower](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-slower.jpg)

**Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)**

You can press the left square bracket ‘**\[**‘ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to ‘**\=**’ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket ‘**\]**’ increases the speed by 0.10x.

**Note:** As it is with the **Slower (fine)** and **Slower** options, you can use **Faster (fine)** to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and **Faster** to increase percentage-wise. Also, if **Faster (fine)** is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the **Faster** option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.

## Part 2: How to Play Slow Motion Effects on Mac with VLC?

The process of slowing down the video playback in VLC on a Mac computer is almost identical to that in Windows. You can learn how to get this done by following the steps that are given below:

**Step 1: Open and Pause the Video**

Locate and right-click the video that you want to play in slow motion, go to **Open With** from the context menu, and click **VLC** from the submenu. Once the clip opens, click the **Pause** button from the bottom as explained in the previous section.

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Click **Playback** from the menu bar at the top, and drag the **Playback Speed** slider to the left to reduce the speed of the video.

![play video slow motion on vlc mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-mac.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

## Part 3: How to Control Playback Speed in VLC Media Player on Android and iOS?

Although the playback speed of a video on both Android and iOS devices can be controlled with a slider, the location where the controller is placed on the two platforms varies, and so does the process of reaching there. Both the methods are explained below for your convenience:

### Play Video in Slow Motion on Android with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Launch VLC on your Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations), locate and open the video in VLC, tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Pause** button from the bottom to pause the playback.

**Step 2: Set a Slower Playback Speed**

Tap the **More** icon from the bottom-right corner, tap **Playback speed** from the menu that appears, and drag the slider that is present at the bottom to the left to reduce the speed. Alternatively, you can also repeatedly tap the down arrow that is present at the right of the slider to slow down the speed in the decrements of 0.05x.

![play speed slow motion vlc android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-speed-slow-motion-vlc-android.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Clock** icon from the lower-left corner. Next, drag the **Playback speed** slider to the left to reduce the playback speed.
