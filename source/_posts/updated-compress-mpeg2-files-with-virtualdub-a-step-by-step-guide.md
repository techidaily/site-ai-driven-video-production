VirtualDub is a free video capture/processing tool for Windows platforms (2000/XP/Vista/7). And VirtualDub MPEG-2 is a modified version of VirtualDub that supports MPEG-2 import originally. However, just as the author said "This software is obsolete and will no longer be updated. For MPEG-2 and WMV support in the latest VirtualDub, try my plugins (MPEG-2 plugin for VirtualDub 1.8.1 or above - by editor)".

## Download and Install VirtualDub MPEG-2

You could [download VirtualDub MPEG-2](http://www.videohelp.com/download/VirtualDub-MPEG224586%20.zip?r=LcPXQgGCmNps) here and extract files to a folder. Now you get a video processing software with MPEG-2 video import supported. To run VirtualDub MPEG-2, double click the VirtualDub.exe.

## How to Use VirtualDub MPEG-2 to Compress Large MPEG-2 Videos

VirtualDub-MPEG2 is designed to work with mpeg2 video, such as Digital TV shows, un-encrypted DVD files (\*.vob) and these video files are usually in big size. Now you can compress them using VirtualDub MPEG-2.

### Step 1: Set Up Video Compression

Open your MPEG-2 video file through File/Open video file..., then go to Video/Compression to bring up the following dialog.

![virtualdub mpeg2](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-video-compression.jpg)

As shown above, select the XVID MPEG-4 codec and click Configure button to make Xvid settings.

![virtualdub mepg2 tutorial](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-mpeg2-compress.jpg)

**Note**: If Compression is disable, switch to Full processing mode first in the Video menu.

### Step 2: Set Up Audio Compression

Audio compression setup is similar to video compression, go to Audio/Full processing mode, and again Audio/Compression to open the dialog, where MPEG Layer-3 is recommended.

### Step 3: Start Compressing

Now it's the time to start processing your video, here is how:

1. Go to the File Menu
2. Select Save as AVI...
3. Select where you want to save the AVI and name it.
4. Click Save.

## Conclusion

The VirtualDub MPEG-2 needs some time to compress your video. The larger the video file is, the longer. But VirtualDub MPEG2 is a fast video processing software. Take a cup of coffee and relax. Once finished, use your favorite video player to see the compressing result.

If you don't like VirtualDub MPEG-2 and would like to find some more powerful editors, you can try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which supports Windows and Mac OS with high compatibility of input and output formats.

Watching the time pass by in front of our eyes is mesmerizing. The fast forwarded scenes of beautiful sunsets, busy streets and all other types of vistas can be found anywhere from Holywood movies to YouTube videos. You don’t need professional camera equipment if you want to create time-lapse videos you can share on your social media accounts because there are plenty of apps that let you create these types of videos directly from your Smartphones. So, in this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the best time-lapse apps for iPhone and Android devices in 2020.

## Best Time-Lapse Apps for Android and iPhone Devices in 2021

The quality of your time-lapse video doesn’t depend only on the number of tools an app offers, which is why you must do everything in your power to record the footage that doesn’t contain camera shakes or any other common mistakes. With that being said, let’s take a look at the five best time-lapse apps you can find on GooglePlay or on the AppStore.

#### 1. [Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.hyperlapsemobile&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android 4.4 or later

**Rating:** 4.2

This Android-based application makes the creation of time-lapse videos look easy. You just have to select the speed at which you want to record a video, choose between 720p and 1080p resolutions and hit the record button. The app lets you increase the video’s speed up to 32 times, enabling you to create seamless time-lapses, although the video stabilization feature is only available if you’re recording a video at a normal speed. That is why you must ensure that your phone is perfectly stable while the recording is in progress if you want to create a smooth time-lapse. Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile lets you share your creations on Instagram, Facebook, and other popular social media networks or save the time-lapse you’ve created to your phone’s SD card.

#### 2. [Slo Mo time lapse vid edit.or](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slo-mo-time-lapse-vid-edit-or/id1198548115?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.0 or later

**Rating:** 4.1

This is a video editing app that doesn’t offer video recording options. However, if you already have the footage you’d like to turn into a time-lapse video, Slo Mo time lapse vid edit.or may be one of the best options you have. Besides creating slow motion and time-lapse videos, you can also use this app to enhance the colors in the footage you’re editing, crop or trim video clips and add customized text overlays to the videos. The app also features a wide spectrum of filters and allows you to add sound effects or music to the video you’re working on. Keep in mind that you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to remove the watermark from your videos or if you want to export your time-lapse and slow-motion videos in Full HD resolution.

#### 3. [Lapse It Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lapse-it-pro-time-lapse-stop-motion-camera-professional-hd/id536495161?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** [Android 2.2 or later](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ui.LapseItPro&hl=en), iOS 11 or later

**Rating:** 4.1 on AppStore, 4.3 on Google Play

The seemingly endless list of options the Lapse It Pro offers makes it a perfect choice for all iPhone and Android users who want to speed up the footage they are recording up to 240 times. The app can be used in both Auto and Manual modes, which means that you can control ISO, Exposure or White Balance values while a recording session is still in progress. In case you don’t want to take photos or record videos with Lapse It Pro, you can import already existing footage into the app and turn it into a stunning time-lapse. The app’s render engine exports UHD 4K videos in remarkably short periods of time, so you can quickly share high-quality videos to any of the popular social media networks.

#### 4. [Hyperlapse from Instagram](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/hyperlapse-from-instagram/id740146917?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.0 or later

**Rating:** 4.4

Making time-lapse videos with this app is so easy that you just have to launch the app, hit the record button and point your iPhone towards the scene you’d like to capture. The best part is that you don’t even need an Instagram account to start using the Hyperlapse from Instagram app. You can increase the video’s speed up to 12 times, and you don’t have to worry about the camera shakes since the app features an automatic stabilization feature that is so powerful that you can shoot all your videos handheld. The time-lapse videos you create with this iOS-based app can be easily saved to your phone’s camera roll or shared to Instagram in only a few taps. The only downside is that Hyperlapse for Instagram doesn’t offer any video editing tools.

#### 5. [Framelapse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Nishant.Singh.DroidTimelapse&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android 4.0 or later

**Rating**: 3.8

Adjusting the frame interval, enhancing the colors in a time-lapse video or selecting the orientation of the video are just a few among countless video recording options the Framelapse app provides. Furthermore, you can control the exposure and white balance values manually or even use the built-in calculator to find out how long the video recording session is going to last. The app allows you to stop recording automatically by setting the duration of the recording, while you can also choose the preferred bitrate or the resolution of the time-lapse video. The free version of Framelapse contains ads, but you can purchase the Pro version of the app that offers even more powerful time-lapse recording options for just $2.99.

**Conclusion**

You no longer need professional cameras, tripods, and [video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create seamless time-lapse videos that depict the passage of time at a certain location. Instead, you can just download an iOS or Android-based app that enables you to have complete creative control over the process of capturing time-lapse videos and share them with your friends on social media. Which app are you going to be using to record time-lapse videos in 2019? Leave a comment and let us know.

Reacting to a video that attracts a lot of attention on the Internet might put you in the middle of the debate the video you’re commenting on is covering.

Click on the Event Pan/Crop button and readjust the size and the on-screen location of the video you’re reacting to.

## Top Mac Video Editing Software: Create Stunning Videos in Minutes

# Best Video Maker for Mac: Easily make videos on Mac

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Finding a good video maker for Mac is not always easy – not for lack of options, there are many applications out there, but there are **two main limitations**: money, first and foremost, we all know how expensive video makers – good video makers – can be. The second limitation is complexity: sometimes you end up spending more time reading the help instead of editing, and the application you've chosen probably contains the features that you need – except that you have serious problems finding them on the menu.

[1\. Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac](#part1)  
[2\. iMovie](#part2)  
[3\. Blender](#part3)

## Best Video Maker for Mac

Some video makers manage to stay on top by avoiding, or at least limiting these problems, and here are three of those.

### 1.Vieo Maker on Mac: [Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora for Mac offers perhaps the best value for money (not to mention that it has a free version as well if you'd like to try it first. It supports pretty much any format you may think of (AVI, MP4, MOV, MPG, MKV, TRP, and so on), and it's quite easy to use when it comes to the most basic features you'd expect in a video editor, such as cropping, joining, trimming, and rotating, as well as for adding some effects, transitions, and sound effects.

Because of that, Wondershare Filmora may actually be deceptively simple – because it's capable of much more powerful features, if you take your time to study all its options, such as **picture in picture, green screen**, if you fancy yourself the next Hollywood director, adjustable playback speed, separation of the audio track from the original video file, tilt-shift effects, which can create very interesting results in a video, automatic noise reduction, and image enhancement, to bring back to life the subjects of the video, and automatic scene detection – allowing you to create a new video clip every time a scene changes. And there are a lot more things you can discover for yourself if you spend some time playing around.

Wondershare Filmora will also allow you to upload your creations directly to **Facebook or YouTube**, or to burn them on DVDs, so you can get straight into the next project without wasting any time.

### 2\. Video Maker for Mac: iMovie

iMovie is the proprietary software provided by Apple as part of its iLife suit. You may find it already installed on your Mac if you've just purchased a new machine. If not, it's free to use after you purchase iLife.

It's not the most powerful and complex application out there, as you can imagine for a piece of software that comes pre-installed, but it's a good first stop for people who are just starting out in this field and need to learn the basics of editing videos on Mac without too many headaches.

It has many easy-to-use effects and lots of build-in animations, music samples, and sounds to get you started on your first project immediately.

Granted, iMovie has sacrificed a lot of features for the simplicity of use – sooner or later you'll want to move on to something more complex, but, for beginners and for people who just need to add a few editing touches to a project here and there, this is a more than the reasonable solution. Don't let yourself put off by the fact iMovie has a rather bad reputation online – of course, that very advanced users are disappointed by it, but you can use it for a while and you'll know when it's time to move on.

### 3\. Video Maker on Mac: Blender

When you've exhausted the possibilities offered by iMovie and you need more power, Blender will be there, waiting for you. It's by far the most impressive of the free video makers for Mac – it's an open-source program, developed by the community – so it's always free to use, you won't stumble upon any hidden charges later on.

Like all open source applications, Blender is not the most intuitive at the first glance, but it more than compensates with the impressive range of features that bring it to the same level as a professional application. If you've been struggling to get everything just perfect before, now you'll have everything you need at your fingertips and you only need to unleash your imagination. It's 3D modeling options have been frequently compared to those that can only be found in applications that cost more than your Mac (maybe even more than your car, come to think of it).

Moreover, the community will always be there for you – if you have any questions or if you get stuck, you only need to post a question online and somebody will be there to help you out – not to mention the very large number of tutorials available online, with more being added almost daily.

If you're not sure about this, you may want to start by searching online for clips created entirely with Blender. Of course, yours won't be masterpieces from day one, it will take some time to get used to this application – but you'll get some idea of how powerful it can be, and the level of mastery that you'll want to achieve, eventually.

Finding a good video maker for Mac is not always easy – not for lack of options, there are many applications out there, but there are **two main limitations**: money, first and foremost, we all know how expensive video makers – good video makers – can be. The second limitation is complexity: sometimes you end up spending more time reading the help instead of editing, and the application you've chosen probably contains the features that you need – except that you have serious problems finding them on the menu.

[2\. iMovie](#part2)  
[3\. Blender](#part3)

## Best Video Maker for Mac

Some video makers manage to stay on top by avoiding, or at least limiting these problems, and here are three of those.

### 1.Vieo Maker on Mac: [Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora for Mac offers perhaps the best value for money (not to mention that it has a free version as well if you'd like to try it first. It supports pretty much any format you may think of (AVI, MP4, MOV, MPG, MKV, TRP, and so on), and it's quite easy to use when it comes to the most basic features you'd expect in a video editor, such as cropping, joining, trimming, and rotating, as well as for adding some effects, transitions, and sound effects.

Because of that, Wondershare Filmora may actually be deceptively simple – because it's capable of much more powerful features, if you take your time to study all its options, such as **picture in picture, green screen**, if you fancy yourself the next Hollywood director, adjustable playback speed, separation of the audio track from the original video file, tilt-shift effects, which can create very interesting results in a video, automatic noise reduction, and image enhancement, to bring back to life the subjects of the video, and automatic scene detection – allowing you to create a new video clip every time a scene changes. And there are a lot more things you can discover for yourself if you spend some time playing around.

Wondershare Filmora will also allow you to upload your creations directly to **Facebook or YouTube**, or to burn them on DVDs, so you can get straight into the next project without wasting any time.

### 2\. Video Maker for Mac: iMovie

iMovie is the proprietary software provided by Apple as part of its iLife suit. You may find it already installed on your Mac if you've just purchased a new machine. If not, it's free to use after you purchase iLife.

It's not the most powerful and complex application out there, as you can imagine for a piece of software that comes pre-installed, but it's a good first stop for people who are just starting out in this field and need to learn the basics of editing videos on Mac without too many headaches.

It has many easy-to-use effects and lots of build-in animations, music samples, and sounds to get you started on your first project immediately.

Granted, iMovie has sacrificed a lot of features for the simplicity of use – sooner or later you'll want to move on to something more complex, but, for beginners and for people who just need to add a few editing touches to a project here and there, this is a more than the reasonable solution. Don't let yourself put off by the fact iMovie has a rather bad reputation online – of course, that very advanced users are disappointed by it, but you can use it for a while and you'll know when it's time to move on.

### 3\. Video Maker on Mac: Blender

When you've exhausted the possibilities offered by iMovie and you need more power, Blender will be there, waiting for you. It's by far the most impressive of the free video makers for Mac – it's an open-source program, developed by the community – so it's always free to use, you won't stumble upon any hidden charges later on.

Like all open source applications, Blender is not the most intuitive at the first glance, but it more than compensates with the impressive range of features that bring it to the same level as a professional application. If you've been struggling to get everything just perfect before, now you'll have everything you need at your fingertips and you only need to unleash your imagination. It's 3D modeling options have been frequently compared to those that can only be found in applications that cost more than your Mac (maybe even more than your car, come to think of it).

Moreover, the community will always be there for you – if you have any questions or if you get stuck, you only need to post a question online and somebody will be there to help you out – not to mention the very large number of tutorials available online, with more being added almost daily.

If you're not sure about this, you may want to start by searching online for clips created entirely with Blender. Of course, yours won't be masterpieces from day one, it will take some time to get used to this application – but you'll get some idea of how powerful it can be, and the level of mastery that you'll want to achieve, eventually.
