04 [How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **6 Best Free MP3 Converter for Windows 10 / 11**

As promised, we start this off with the best **audio converter** (**Windows 10**/11) tools. We've decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE **MP3 Converters** (**Windows**), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter's interface looks like.

### 01**EaseUs MobiMover**

EaseUs MobiMover is an **audio converter for Windows 10** and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It's a FREEmium software though — which means that it's use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.

![EaseUs MobiMover - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%201.png)

### 02**Freemake Video Converter**

Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE **MP3 converter for Windows 10** on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It's a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)

![Freemake Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%202.png)

### 03**VSDC**

Much like Freemake, our next **MP3 converter for Windows 10** and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it's not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an **audio-video-converter for Windows 10** (and vice versa.)

![VSDC - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%203.png)

### 04**Convertio.co**

With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!

![Convertio - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%204.png)

### 05**Free Convert**

Free Convert is another online **MP3 convert for Windows 10** users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you'll have to pay for the premium version.

![Free Convert - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%205.png)

### 06**DVDVideoSoft**

With DVDVideoSoft, we're back to an **audio-video converter for Windows 10** that you have to download and install to work! It's a FREEmium software too. That means that you'll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.

![DVDVideoSoft](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%206.png)

## Part 2 **6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac**

For this next section, we turn our attention to a couple of **MP3 editors** (**Windows 10** and Mac compatible.) This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we'll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.

### 01**Wondershare Filmora**

Operating System: Windows/Mac

Today's Best Deals: US$89.99 (one-time)

The first on our list is the **MP3 editor Windows 10** and Mac compatible, [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) This is an advanced video editing software that you can use in order to work on just about any digital project — including, of course, editing your MP3 audio files.

**Reasons to Buy:**

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

**●** Confusing interface

![Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%208.png)

### 03**Ashampoo Music Studio 8**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: US$29.99

Next up is Ashampoo's Music Studio 8! Here's another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it's the tool that you're looking for, but you'll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it's quite the effective **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** (among other things). So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Clean, modern interface

**●** Beginner-friendly editing tools

**●** One-time fee only

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Freemium software (one-time payment required)

**●** Available only for Windows!

**●** Cannot support multiple tracks

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%209.png)

### 04**Ocenaudio**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

As far as audio-editing goes, you're probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that's all you're looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Beginner-friendly audio editor

**●** Simple, clean interface

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older software

**●** Open-source, not updated as often

**●** Only an audio-editing software

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2010.png)

### 05**Acoustica**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Our next pick is another open-source, **MP3 editor for Windows 10**. It's called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it's a fairly advanced audio editing tool. You should note, however, that the newer versions of this product are PAID (only older models are free), which is the topic of our discussion today.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source product

**●** Advanced audio editing tools

**●** Advanced exporting formats

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older version of the software

**●** Updated version is PAID

**●** Available only for Windows

![Acoustica](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2011.png)

### 06**Audiotool**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it's certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn't mean that it won't work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux users

**●** Advanced audio editing

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Complex editing interface

**●** Requires internet to work (Linux)

**●** Not regularly updated

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

![Save Finished Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2022.png)

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

04 [How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **6 Best Free MP3 Converter for Windows 10 / 11**

As promised, we start this off with the best **audio converter** (**Windows 10**/11) tools. We've decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE **MP3 Converters** (**Windows**), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter's interface looks like.

### 01**EaseUs MobiMover**

EaseUs MobiMover is an **audio converter for Windows 10** and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It's a FREEmium software though — which means that it's use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.

![EaseUs MobiMover - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%201.png)

### 02**Freemake Video Converter**

Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE **MP3 converter for Windows 10** on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It's a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)

![Freemake Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%202.png)

### 03**VSDC**

Much like Freemake, our next **MP3 converter for Windows 10** and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it's not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an **audio-video-converter for Windows 10** (and vice versa.)

![VSDC - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%203.png)

### 04**Convertio.co**

With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!

![Convertio - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%204.png)

### 05**Free Convert**

Free Convert is another online **MP3 convert for Windows 10** users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you'll have to pay for the premium version.

![Free Convert - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%205.png)

### 06**DVDVideoSoft**

With DVDVideoSoft, we're back to an **audio-video converter for Windows 10** that you have to download and install to work! It's a FREEmium software too. That means that you'll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.

![DVDVideoSoft](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%206.png)

## Part 2 **6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac**

For this next section, we turn our attention to a couple of **MP3 editors** (**Windows 10** and Mac compatible.) This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we'll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.

### 01**Wondershare Filmora**

Operating System: Windows/Mac

Today's Best Deals: US$89.99 (one-time)

The first on our list is the **MP3 editor Windows 10** and Mac compatible, [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) This is an advanced video editing software that you can use in order to work on just about any digital project — including, of course, editing your MP3 audio files.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Lots of editing tools for MP3 files

**●** Exports high-quality end-products

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Download and installation is required

![Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%207.png)

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

**●** Confusing interface

**●** Difficult to use for beginners

![Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%208.png)

### 03**Ashampoo Music Studio 8**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: US$29.99

Next up is Ashampoo's Music Studio 8! Here's another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it's the tool that you're looking for, but you'll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it's quite the effective **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** (among other things). So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Clean, modern interface

**●** Beginner-friendly editing tools

**●** One-time fee only

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Freemium software (one-time payment required)

**●** Available only for Windows!

**●** Cannot support multiple tracks

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%209.png)

### 04**Ocenaudio**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

As far as audio-editing goes, you're probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that's all you're looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Beginner-friendly audio editor

**●** Simple, clean interface

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older software

**●** Open-source, not updated as often

**●** Only an audio-editing software

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2010.png)

### 05**Acoustica**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Our next pick is another open-source, **MP3 editor for Windows 10**. It's called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it's a fairly advanced audio editing tool. You should note, however, that the newer versions of this product are PAID (only older models are free), which is the topic of our discussion today.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source product

**●** Advanced audio editing tools

**●** Advanced exporting formats

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older version of the software

**●** Updated version is PAID

**●** Available only for Windows

![Acoustica](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2011.png)

### 06**Audiotool**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it's certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn't mean that it won't work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux users

**●** Advanced audio editing

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Complex editing interface

**●** Requires internet to work (Linux)

**●** Not regularly updated

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

**●** Confusing interface

**●** Difficult to use for beginners

### 03**Ashampoo Music Studio 8**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: US$29.99

Next up is Ashampoo's Music Studio 8!

So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Clean, modern interface

**●** Beginner-friendly editing tools

**●** One-time fee only

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**Reasons to Buy:**

### 06**Audiotool**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it's certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below).

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

![Save Finished Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2022.png)

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** There are multiple **MP3 converters for Windows** and Mac that you can use in order to convert videos to an audio file that you can use for certain projects.

**●** Of course, if you want your finished project to sound clean, you'll probably need a functional audio editor for that! And, for this matter, we recommend advanced video editing software like Filmora Pro.

**●** Just in case you want to review what your converted audio sounds like, consider one of the audio players that are available for Windows and Mac!

**●** If you find that your audio needs some trimming, a quick trim with an audio cutter should do the trick. It's very simple to do!

This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.

Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.

#### 2\. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’

Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.

### 3\. Timescapes

This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.

### 4\. Boat Scenes

There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.

### 5\. Tears of Steel trailer

Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.

### 6\. Sintel

Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.

Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.

### 7\. Stock Footage Sample

This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.

### 8\. Honey Bees

Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.

#### 9\. Skyfall Trailer

Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.

#### 10\. Fireworks

This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K. Color rendition, detail, it has it all. It opens with a magnificent view across the city showing the lights at dusk and beyond, and then into the stunning firework display, it really is quite spectacular and a great look at 4K footage.

That’s our top 10, not all the best technically, but each offers something a little different to give a taste of what 4K is all about, and exactly what your 4K screen is capable of.

There are multiple 4K video converters with powerful functions.

## Seamless Transitions: The Art of Color Matching in PowerDirector

# How to Color Match Different Video Clips in PowerDirector?

_“How good is CyberLink PowerDirector when it comes to automatic color matching?”_

CyberLink is one of the best video editors with features including motion tracking, screen recording, Multicam editing, etc. It further consists of tools such as titles, transitions, and effects to use quickly. However, we need to talk here about the **PowerDirector color match** process and assess its easiness. No matter how good a video editor is, the process must be simple to understand for the primary users. So, let’s begin with the step-by-step guide on how to color match different video clips in PowerDirector.

The Color Match feature of CyberLink PowerDirector allows matching tones and colors on selected video clips.

## Part 1: How to Color Match Different Video Clips in PowerDirector?

Applying color match/color correction to different clips at the same time also speeds up your workflow.

**Step 1: Download ColorDirector**

The first step to effectively do color matching in CyberLink PowerDirector is to download the ColorDirector. It contains a real camera and color effects to achieve cinematic color match editing.

**Step 2: Apply Presets to multiple clips on singletrack**

We assume that you already have clips imported into the timeline. Thus, do a left-click on the first clip, select **Fix/Enhance** tab, and then choose **ColorDirector** in the preview window.

**Step 3: Make manual adjustments**

Yes, you are required to make manual adjustments by clicking the **Manual** and **Adjustments** tab in the preview window.

You can now make some adjustments to **RGB Channel**, as here we have made it a little darker.

After you’re over with the manual adjustment, click **Back** to go back to the PowerDirector. Now, you can see that an adjustment is made to the selected clip.

Then, you need to click **Apply to All** and see the effect getting added to all the clips on the same track.

**Step 4: Apply color match adjustments at different tracks**

Again, apply the same process by left-clicking the video clip on a different track. Select **Fix/Enhance** and then go to **Color Director**.

Now, make some adjustments to the **RBG Channel** as we have made it a little brighter here. Then, you need to save this adjustment as Preset to apply to multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks. Hit the **Create** \> **Preset** tab as shown in the image below.

Then, you can name the **Preset** and hit on **Save** tab.

After you go back to the PowerDirector, you can see your recently-saved preset in the **Presets** list.

Now, select multiple clips. Left-click on a clip, hold the **Ctrl** key, then left-click on another clip while holding the **Ctrl** key, and so on. You will be able to choose more than one clip in this manner.

Then, check the **Color Presets/CLUTs** tab and select the **Preset** that you have saved to apply on multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks.

So, these were the steps of **PowerDirector color match** manual adjustments. We have only adjusted **RGB Channel**, but there are many others to look for and consider.

## Part 2: An Easier Solution to Automatically Matching the Color of Video Footage

Got confused by manual adjustments? There is an alternative solution if you also hate the manual process of color adjustments in CyberLink PowerDirector. Go no far than the professional yet beginner-friendly [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to check in for automatic color match adjustments. Yes, you don't have to go for separate adjustments in RGB Channel, etc., as you have done before.

_“How good is CyberLink PowerDirector when it comes to automatic color matching?”_

CyberLink is one of the best video editors with features including motion tracking, screen recording, Multicam editing, etc. It further consists of tools such as titles, transitions, and effects to use quickly. However, we need to talk here about the **PowerDirector color match** process and assess its easiness. No matter how good a video editor is, the process must be simple to understand for the primary users. So, let’s begin with the step-by-step guide on how to color match different video clips in PowerDirector.

The Color Match feature of CyberLink PowerDirector allows matching tones and colors on selected video clips.

## Part 1: How to Color Match Different Video Clips in PowerDirector?

Applying color match/color correction to different clips at the same time also speeds up your workflow.

**Step 1: Download ColorDirector**

The first step to effectively do color matching in CyberLink PowerDirector is to download the ColorDirector. It contains a real camera and color effects to achieve cinematic color match editing.

**Step 2: Apply Presets to multiple clips on singletrack**

We assume that you already have clips imported into the timeline. Thus, do a left-click on the first clip, select **Fix/Enhance** tab, and then choose **ColorDirector** in the preview window.

**Step 3: Make manual adjustments**

Yes, you are required to make manual adjustments by clicking the **Manual** and **Adjustments** tab in the preview window.

You can now make some adjustments to **RGB Channel**, as here we have made it a little darker.

After you’re over with the manual adjustment, click **Back** to go back to the PowerDirector. Now, you can see that an adjustment is made to the selected clip.

Then, you need to click **Apply to All** and see the effect getting added to all the clips on the same track.

**Step 4: Apply color match adjustments at different tracks**

Again, apply the same process by left-clicking the video clip on a different track. Select **Fix/Enhance** and then go to **Color Director**.

Now, make some adjustments to the **RBG Channel** as we have made it a little brighter here. Then, you need to save this adjustment as Preset to apply to multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks. Hit the **Create** \> **Preset** tab as shown in the image below.
