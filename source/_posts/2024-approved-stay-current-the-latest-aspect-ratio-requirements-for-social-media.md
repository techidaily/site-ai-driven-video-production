The process of making a reaction video in iMovie isn’t much different from the process of making any other type of video. Before you start working on your new reaction video, you need to make sure that you have all the media files you want you to use in your project. You can then simply import them into iMovie, and place footage of yourself reacting to a video to the timeline. Afterward, you should place the actual video to which you are reacting above or below the video file that contains the footage of your reaction, depending on which video clip you want to use as a background video.

However, the overlaid video is not going to be automatically visible in the preview screen, so you should just click on the Video Overlay Settings and pick the Picture in Picture option. As soon as you select this option the overlay video will become visible in the preview window, where you can adjust its size and position. When ready, you should export your reaction video and upload it to your channel.

**Pros**

* The quick and easy video editing process
* Available to all Mac users for free
* Excellent for inexperienced video editors
* A rich selection of visual effects

**Cons**

* No screen capturing tools
* Audio editing options could be better

### 4\. [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows, Linux

OBS is a [screencasting software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that enables you to create live streams or record all actions you perform on your computer’s screen. After you launch OBS, you should select the For Recording option, and this reaction video maker will optimize the project settings automatically. Once the OBS’ main window loads, you just have to specify the sources from which you want to record the footage. Simply right-click anywhere within the Sources tab, select the Add option and choose the Display Capture setting from the submenu.

You can then repeat the same process to select Audio Output Capture option, in order to record the audio from the video you’re reacting to. Afterward, you should head over to the Add menu once more and add the Video Capture Device to the Sources tab. Optionally, you can readjust the size of each video source in the Preview Window, and hit the Start Recording button.

**Pros**

* Free for PC and Mac users
* Enables users to specify the format of the output video
* Captures videos in HD resolution
* Excellent audio recording features

**Cons**

* OBS crashes easily
* Not aimed at inexperienced users

### 5\. [VegasPro 18](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/)

**Price:** Freemium

**Compatibility:** Windows

Both the video of your reaction and the video to which you are reacting must be recorded before you start editing them in Sony Vegas Pro. Making a reaction video with this video editing software is a relatively easy task that only requires you to position your footage correctly on the timeline.

The video containing your reaction should be below the video you are commenting on so that the second video can be treated as an overlay. Click on the Event Pan/Crop button and readjust the size and the on-screen location of the video you’re reacting to. When done, you can proceed to sync both videos so that your reactions correspond with the events in the other video. Don’t forget to preview the reaction video you’ve created before exporting it.

**Pros**

* Offers professional video editing tools
* Grants users full control over the footage
* Intuitive and modernly designed interface
* Supports a broad range of output file formats

**Cons**

* Aimed only at professional video editors
* Capturing a computer screen with Sony Vegas Pro is not possible

**Conclusion**

In order to gather thousands of views, comments, and likes, every detail in your reaction videos needs to be perfect. Video reaction makers we featured in this article enable you to have complete creative control over the process of making a reaction video.

Among all these above, if you want to go for a free one, I'll say you should go for **OBS.**
