This option is best suited for video editors who want to create their intros because RocketStok's Cinematic Style Library extends the scope of options provided by Premiere Pro.

Downloading all fonts except Helvetica Neue is free, but you must check which fonts you can use in commercial projects. You will have no trouble installing the fonts since you can just double-click on the font and follow the on-screen instructions.

Once you've installed all the fonts from the library, you can use them to replace the software's default library. You just have to click on the Replace Style Library option that can be accessed from Premiere Pro's Title Style tab.

If you don't feel comfortable creating your titles or if you simply don't have the time to create your own titles, the Free Cinematic Style Library is not the best choice for you.

On the other hand, Premiere Pro's users who don't often use title templates can benefit from downloading RocketStock's intro library.

## Part 3: How to Import and Customize Title Templates in Premiere

If you download the template, all the title templates support customization. You can change its size, font, color, and add 3D effects.

It is easy to import and use it to touch up your video. Check out the steps below to know how to import title templates quickly.

1. **Install the title template**. Choose one template you like and download it to your PC. Remember to unzip it before importing it. Now install them.
2. **Import the title template**. You just need to go to click **Effects** at the top. Then at right, you will find Presets in the effects section.
3. Right-click on presets, and choose **Import Presets**. If the title template format is .mogrt, you need to open it in Essential Graphics Panel. At the bottom right corner, click the plus icon to import the title template and install it.
4. **Customize the title template**. Once the title template is imported, drag it to the timeline. Click the Editing tab. Here you can customize colors, text, opacities, and positions. There are more options for you to explore.
5. You can also copy and paste the title template to another place in the timeline. If you change one place of the pasted template, the original one will remain the same.

**Note**: each version of Premiere's interface will look different, but the workflow is similar.

### Conclusion

Using title templates can help you achieve a certain visual style faster, so you don't have to spend a lot of time looking for a perfect background or animating the text.

The Internet provides almost unlimited video editing resources, but not all of these resources can be acquired for free.

Which website you will choose as a source of fresh title templates depends on how often you work on new projects in Adobe Premiere Pro.
