02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.

If you want to make permanent adjustments, use a convertor or editor. "Wondershare Filmora" is the best video editor that allows you to create videos with different aspect ratios and adjust these ratios easily.
