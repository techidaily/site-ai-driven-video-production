Stop motion animations are famous for their unique visual style, however, creating a stop motion animation is a difficult task even for an experienced professional. The Stop Motion Studio makes creating this type of animation somewhat easier by enabling you to preview the images you’re taking with your Sony, Canon or Nikon DSLR cameras directly from the software.

Even a brief look at the list of this cross-platform app will leave you wondering if there is anything you cannot do. However, Stop Motion Studio is not aimed at children or users that don’t have a considerable amount of experience with this animation technique. Aspiring animation professionals can utilize the Stop Motion Studio to create animations for children.

**Pros**

* Provides powerful stop-animation tools
* Grants users full control over camera settings
* Exports videos in 4K

**Cons**

* Stop motion tools these app offers are too advanced for children
* The output files can be too large to share on social media
