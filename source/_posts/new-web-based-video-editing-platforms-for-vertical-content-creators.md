 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

The videos you record with your phone need to be edited before you share them on social media. Whether you want to apply a visual effect just to trim the footage, either way, you are going to need a **video editing app** that enables you to perform these tasks.

You donâ€™t necessarily need to install a video editor on your Smartphone or computer if you just want to brush up your videos quickly before you post them, because there is a variety of web-based [online video editing platforms](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that offer all basic video editing tools.

In this article, we are going to take you through some of the best web-based online vertical video editors that you can use on Windows, Mac, Linux or ChromeBook. Note: The software listed below are in no particular order.

## Top 7 web-based vertical video editors

Even though going through [the aspect ratios](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) a video editing platform supports is important, especially if you want to edit vertically oriented videos, this shouldnâ€™t be the only aspect you consider while choosing a web-based video editor.

The affordability and the available video editing tools can also play an important role in your decision as they determine how efficiently you can edit a vertically oriented video. Letâ€™s take a look at some of the top six web-based vertical video editors.

### 2. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/)

All you need to do is upload the vertical video to the platform and pick which video editing action you want to perform.

Uploading files that have more than 250MB is not possible on the free version of Kapwing, although the platform doesnâ€™t add a watermark to the videos you edit.
