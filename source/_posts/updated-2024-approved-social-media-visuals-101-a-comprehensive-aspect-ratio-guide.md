 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

## What Are Public Domain Images?

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

## How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?

 A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks.

 With a library that contains over 800,000 photos, Unsplash is easily one of the largest websites that offer public domain images. All pictures on this platform are organized into different categories, which makes finding a photo you want to use in a commercial or non-commercial project a relatively simple process. Alternatively, you can insert a keyword into a search bar and Unsplash will show you the results within seconds. However, the images you can find on this platform are similar to those you can purchase on stock photography websites, although some of them have an artistic touch that is hard to find on the majority of stock photos.

**Pros:**

* Excellent source of high-resolution photos
* Quick and easy search

**Cons:**

* Unsplash is dedicated solely to photography
* Limited amount of available public domain images

#### 6. [From Old Books](https://www.fromoldbooks.org/)

* Some images are not free
* Rudimentary website design

#### 7. [Morguefile](https://morguefile.com/)

![Morguefile public domain image  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/morguefile-public-domain-search.jpg)

 Morguefile is a website that offers stock footage to its users, but some of the images can’t be downloaded for free. That’s why you must click on the Free Photos tab before you start searching for public domain images on this website. The website hosts nearly 400.000 photos, videos, and vector graphics, but you must make sure that a file you want to download is within the public domain before you download it. The only downside is that the images aren’t organized into categories which can make finding the images you’re searching for more difficult than it needs to be.

**Pros:**

* Creating an account on Morguefile is free
* All free photos can be used on commercial projects

**Cons:**

* Images can be organized better
* Fewer free images than on other public domain image websites

#### 8. [Public Domain Archive](https://www.publicdomainarchive.com/)

All photos are organized into categories like abstract, free stock photos, people or wood which makes the search simpler. However, these categories don’t contain more than a few hundred photos and some of them offer as few as five pictures you can download. All photos are in high resolution and ready for professional use. The download process can be completed effortlessly in just a few quick steps. New images are added on a weekly basis.

**Pros:**

* Professional quality of images
* All images are free

Before you enter a keyword you should click on the search only public domain materials tick box to ensure that the search results are going to display only images that can be used without restrictions. Additionally, the NYPL Digital Gallery lets you browse through its collection of digital books while its collections of photographs include the work of some of the highly esteemed American photographers.

**Pros**

* Public domain images are available in different resolutions
* Offers valuable research materials

**Cons**

* Some images are subject to copyright
* Only aimed at scholars and researchers

#### 10. [Viintage](https://www.viintage.com/)

 Viintage is a gold mine for graphic designers as it grants them access to hundreds of vintage posters, book covers, and images. However, the amount of public domain images this website offers is limited and if you want to download the images from the collections of works created by famous artists from the late 19th and early 20th centuries you must purchase the premium version of Viintage. The website lacks some basic search options as it only allows you to type in the search term into the search bar. The images are not organized into categories which further complicates the process of finding a public domain image you’re looking for.

**Pros:**

* Offers a collection of rare vintage public domain images
* A great resource for graphic designers

**Cons:**

* Most images on Viintage can’t be downloaded for free
* Search tools are far from perfect

## How to Cite Public Domain Images Properly?

 If you’re planning on using a public domain image in a blog or on your website, you must cite the source from which you acquired a particular image. The image citations should include the following information:

* The title of the image
* Author’s name
* Information about the institution at which an image is kept
* The source from which you acquired an image

 In case you don’t have access to all of these information or if the information is simply not available you should include all details about a public domain image you have the access to. Furthermore, there are several styles of image citations that depend on the source from which an image was acquired.

**Conclusion**

 Spending large sums of money on images you can use in commercial or private projects is not always necessary. The public domain images are widely available and they can be used in a broad range of contexts. Which website that lets you download public domain images do you like to use the most?

This article has all the answers that you need. Let's get started!

> * [Part 4: FAQ](#part4)

## Part 1: How to get and download Final Cut Pro demo for 90 days?

 As it might be clear by now, Final Cut Pro is a professional video editing software and a product for Apple. Also, Final Cut Pro costs hundreds of dollars [(See details about Final Cut Pro price here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/final-cut-pro-price.html) if you choose to purchase, so the 90-day offer has come in as a massive relief for those who want to try its features for free for more days. People who are already using the earlier Final Cut Pro trial version will be able to use it for another 90 days without paying anything.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![fcpx-mac-store](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fcpx-mac-store.png)

For those who already try out Final Cut Pro and are happy with the editor, you can see how to [save money with the education bundle of Apple.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

And for those who are trying out Final Cut Pro, here is a collection of [FCPX tutorials](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for you to get started with!

## Part 2: Why Final Cut Pro trial won't open?

 Although there shouldn't be any issue in downloading the Final Cut Pro trial version, if you meet your system's requirements, some customers are complaining that they can't download or install the Final Cur Pro trial package. Well, if that's happening, there could be a few reasons which are highlighted below.

![fcpx-in-mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fcpx-in-mac.jpg)

**Poor Internet Connection**

The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won't be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.

**Check System Requirements**

To download the Final Cut Pro free trial version, your Mac system has to meet Apple's minimum requirements. Even if one of the requirements fails to meet, you won't be able to download Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial. To try the latest version, the OS has to be 10.15.6 or later. Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement. If the OS is not updated, update it before trying to download the package.

**Try Using Another Account**

Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.

**Quit and Restart your System**

If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.

**Disconnect External Devices**

If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.

## Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?

 Final Cut Pro free trial version will be over after 90 days because that's their policy. Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.

 ![trial-expire](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/trial-expire.jpg)

Code to reset Final Cut Pro 10.4.4

 #!/usr/bin/swift

 import Foundation

 let path = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSString(string: "\~/Library/Application Support/.ffuserdata").expandingTildeInPath)

 let data = try! NSData(contentsOf: path) as Data

 let dictionary = try! NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(data) as! NSDictionary

 let mutableDictionary = dictionary.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableDictionary

 for (key, value) in mutableDictionary {

 if value is NSDate {

 mutableDictionary\[key\] = Date()

 }

 }

 try! NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: mutableDictionary, requiringSecureCoding: false).write(to: path)

 print("You'd better buy it")

 It's quite complicated that you will have to enter this code manually into the terminal each time the trial expires. Regrettably, there is no way to extend the free trial permanently, so you will have to repeat this part over and over again.

But to be aware, this may lead to a ban or other punishment to your account by Apple Inc.

Anyway, it makes sense why people want to stick to their free trial! Final Cut Pro is not an affordable video editing tool.

If you love fcpx that much but can't afford it, [see how to get fcpx with the cheapest price here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Or, you can try other powerful editors with much lower prices, like Filmora.

## Part 4: FAQ

**What is the limitation of the trial version of FCPX?**

Final Cut Pro Additional Content, which includes over 1300 royalty-free sound effects for use in your projects, isn’t available in the Final Cut Pro trial. The trial is fully functional otherwise.

You can import media, edit, organize, add effects, color correct, export files in a variety of professional formats, and more. Get an overview of Final Cut Pro.

**Is Final Cut Pro worth the price?**

Final Cut Pro comes with robust video editing features, which can help you create stunning and professional-level videos. However, Final Cut Pro is not for beginners, and if $299 is a little too expensive for you, it is better to find another video editing tool that won't cost you this much and will let you create professional-looking videos effortlessly. This is when Filmora by Wondershare comes into play.

The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won't be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.

**Check System Requirements**

To download the Final Cut Pro free trial version, your Mac system has to meet Apple's minimum requirements. Even if one of the requirements fails to meet, you won't be able to download Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial. To try the latest version, the OS has to be 10.15.6 or later. Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement. If the OS is not updated, update it before trying to download the package.

**Try Using Another Account**

Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.

**Quit and Restart your System**

If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.

**Disconnect External Devices**

If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.

## Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?

 Final Cut Pro free trial version will be over after 90 days because that's their policy. Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.

 ![trial-expire](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/trial-expire.jpg)

Code to reset Final Cut Pro 10.4.4

 #!/usr/bin/swift

 import Foundation

 let path = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSString(string: "\~/Library/Application Support/.ffuserdata").expandingTildeInPath)

 let data = try! NSData(contentsOf: path) as Data

 let dictionary = try! NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(data) as! NSDictionary

 let mutableDictionary = dictionary.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableDictionary

 for (key, value) in mutableDictionary {

 if value is NSDate {

 mutableDictionary\[key\] = Date()

 }

 }

 try! NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: mutableDictionary, requiringSecureCoding: false).write(to: path)

 print("You'd better buy it")

 It's quite complicated that you will have to enter this code manually into the terminal each time the trial expires. Regrettably, there is no way to extend the free trial permanently, so you will have to repeat this part over and over again.

But to be aware, this may lead to a ban or other punishment to your account by Apple Inc.

Anyway, it makes sense why people want to stick to their free trial! Final Cut Pro is not an affordable video editing tool.

## Part 4: FAQ

**What is the limitation of the trial version of FCPX?**

Final Cut Pro Additional Content, which includes over 1300 royalty-free sound effects for use in your projects, isn’t available in the Final Cut Pro trial. The trial is fully functional otherwise.

You can import media, edit, organize, add effects, color correct, export files in a variety of professional formats, and more. Get an overview of Final Cut Pro.

**Is Final Cut Pro worth the price?**

Final Cut Pro comes with robust video editing features, which can help you create stunning and professional-level videos. However, Final Cut Pro is not for beginners, and if $299 is a little too expensive for you, it is better to find another video editing tool that won't cost you this much and will let you create professional-looking videos effortlessly. This is when Filmora by Wondershare comes into play.
