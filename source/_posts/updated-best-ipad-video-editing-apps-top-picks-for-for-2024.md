In this article we will walk you through the best video editing software that's worth your money. Thus, scroll down to find the five best iPad Pro Video Editor of 2024\.

* [**Part 1: 5 Best Video Editing Apps for iPad**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Edit Video on Desktop with Filmora**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: FAQ**](#part3)

## Part 1: 5 Best Video Editing Apps for iPad

### 1\. Filmora (Recommended)

Available for iOS (i.e., for iPad) and Android users, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the most viable option if you want to take your videos to the next level from your mobile screens. The easy-to-use interface allows even the naivest users to adapt the video skills quickly plus it being easy-on-eyes also enables you to edit videos seamlessly. Given the dedicated options for everything — tripping & cutting videos to adding audio, photos, and subtitles — editing videos will not take time.

[![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/google_play.jpg) ](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) [![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/apple_store.jpg)](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6)

**Pros:**

* New upgrades have brought Advanced Crop features
* You can set duration of video motion
* Filmora includes all the basic video-editing features you might expect, like cutting, merging, cropping, and rotating video footage

**Cons:**

* Filmora does have a free version, but the video will be watermarked

**Price:**

**Free version available**

Filmora Pro (1 Year) — $32.99

Filmora Pro （1 Month） — $6.99

Remove Logo Roll — $4.99more

### 2\. LumaFusion (best for iPad)

Recommended for iPad users, LumaFusion is a multitrack mobile video editor used by professionals. However, unlike Filmora, LumaFusion does not make it simple for an average Joe to utilize the application to its full extent. In fact, LumaFusion recommends video tutorials if you are a beginner to video-editing. Nevertheless, when it comes to feature-set, LumaFusion has one of the most advanced libraries of features that allows you to tell compelling video stories.

**Pros:**

* Uncluttered, intuitive, and customizable user interface
* Advanced and adjustable image stabilizer
* Simple color correction — you do not have to fret with color wheels, video scopes, auto white balance, nodes, or any settings; instead, it includes a handful of color presets and sliders to make the process more convenient.
* Edit up to six layers of audio and video
* Supports all major video formats and more!

**Cons:**

* No android app available yet
* Not friendly for beginners
* No free version

**Price:** US$ 29.99, extra subscription for Storyblocks needed

### 3\. iMovie

Of course, how can we forget Apple’s native iMovie video editor? Yes, it lacks some bells and whistles, but it makes basic video editing a breeze. Suitable for beginners, iMovie's main aim is to provide ease of use in a clean and elegant interface. In all, you will not find advanced video-editing options. But when it comes to basic features like tripping, cutting, adding audio, subtitles, and transition effects — iMovie is second to no one in terms of usability.

**Pros:**

* Cross-platform apps for all Apple devices
* Features like the Trailer timeline make the whole process seamless
* Simple and easy-to-use interface — suitable for beginners
* Good range of fun templates
* Multiple audio-editing options
* Completely free to use

**Cons:**

* For the sake of simplicity, iMovie excludes some critical functions like motion-tracking and more.
* No advanced options like editing 360-degree video editing

**Price:** Free

### 4\. KineMaster

In the world where iPad Pro video editors rise and fall, KineMaster has survived all these years because of its powerful features and simplicity. Overall, if you are looking for a tool to edit videos on the go — you should take a serious look at KineMaster.

**Pros:**

**Price:**

* Premium Monthly — $7.99
* Premium Yearly — $35.99
* Legacy - Remove Watermark — $29.99
* Premium One-Time Purchase — $69.99

### 5\. Filmmaker Pro

Holding features like LUT effects, 4K capability, chroma key to add crazy 3D transitions, Filmmaker Pro is a viable option for any beginner learning how to edit videos.

**Pros:**

* Cross-platform support
* Multiple export options like YouTube
* Intuitive and simple interface

**Cons:**

* Subscription is compulsory if you want to remove the watermarks

**Price:**

* US$ 5.99 per month

## Part 2: Edit Video on Desktop with Filmora

The reason [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the most recommended tool (and even our favorite) is its attractive feature-set and cost-effective pricing. Available for both macOS and Windows, Wondershare’s Filmora is the best software if you are looking for a computer tool for HD video editing.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 3: FAQ

**Is the New M1 iPad Pro Good for Video Editing?**

Like most Apple products, the iPad Pro exterior hasn’t changed much compared to its predecessors, as the real magical upgrades are inside. The new M1 chip, the magnificent XDR display, 120Hz Refresh Rate, unbelievable Performance, Magic Keyboard, Thunderbolt 3, and USB 4 is enough to recognize the latest iPad Pro as the most powerful tablet ever made that can do everything that a Laptop can! Other hallmarks like the trackpad and magnetic slide — make it the perfect substitute for anyone looking to replace their laptop with an iPad Pro for video editing.

## Part4: Conclusion

Touch screens can be difficult to handle when performing precise operations like video-editing; that is why it is critical to use only the best video-editors on iPad.

## Get the Picture: Free Commercial Image Solutions

Did you know that some of the world's most iconic advertisements use stock images for commercial use? For example, AlamapBBDO, a Brazilian ad agency, used stock photos from Getty Images to create their [Endless Possibilities campaign](https://thinkmarketingmagazine.com/getty-images-brilliant-campaign-re-create-4-famous-faces-out-of-random-stock-photos/) in 2016\. The advertising campaign combined photos of random people's faces to recreate portraits of famous people such as the Dalai Lama and Pope Francis.

![images for commercial use](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-1.jpg)

Most creative agencies prefer altering stock images in most of their work. This is because it allows them to create campaigns for different companies much faster at affordable costs. Keep reading to find out how to get free images for commercial use in your next project.

## Part 1: Download images in loyalty-free sites

Several sites offer free images for commercial use as part of their services. In addition, you do not need to register an account to download the images. The sites typically rely on user contributions and content teams to ensure their databases are fresh and maintain consistent quality. Furthermore, all creative assets they offer fall under the creative commons zero license or a variation of it. Here are some of the sites that offer you images for commercial use for free.

### 1\. Pexels

![pexels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-2.jpg)

Pexels.com is a free-to-use provider of high-resolution photos and videos for aspiring creators. The German-based website was started in 2014 by two brothers and has been under the Canva umbrella since 2018.

Currently, the website hosts over 3.2 million images and videos from over 250,000 active contributors. In addition, all the material you find in its library is under the Pexels license, which slightly varies from the creative commons zero license model. Some of the restrictions it enforces include:

* You can only use pexels images for commercial use after making alterations to the original image. For example, you can use part of an image to create a collage for your commercial branding.
* Furthermore, you cannot use any of the website's content to promote political ideologies and explicit content, especially if the images contain identifiable subjects.

Pexels is available through the following channels:

* Your web browser by typing the URL pexels.com.
* The Android and iOS app.
* A plugin for other content creation software such as Google Slides and MS Office.
* An extension on your Chrome browser.
* You can also access the database using the official Canva app.

### 2\. Unsplash

![unsplash](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-3.jpg)

Another website that offers free images for commercial use is Unsplash, a subsidiary of Getty Images since 2021\. The website is a favorite among creators boasting over 16 billion photo impressions monthly. In addition, the database consists of over 3.48 million photos from more than 265,000 unique contributors, all under the Unsplash license.

The Unsplash license restricts the sale of its creative assets without incorporating new creative elements, including using them in print media and physical goods such as mugs and caps.

You can access Unsplash from your web browser or request API integration for your application from the site's owners. In addition, the site also hosts photo walks across different cities, where Unsplash guides show you the best photo locations around the city and the best camera techniques for your work. Some cities to host the event include Boston, Montreal, Tokyo, and Toronto.

### 3\. Freerange

![freerange](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-4.jpg)

Freerange Stock is an online resource for photos, illustrations, and textures you can download and use for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Since 2007, the site has continued to provide high-quality images to its community of over 800,000 registered users.

Unlike the previous examples, all content on Freerange falls under the website's Equalicense. It grants you broad commercial rights of its stock images while allowing the contributors to retain control of their copyright, image resale, and distribution. As such, you cannot use the images for bulk distribution or print-on-demand works.

Freerange Stock maintains its steady supply of images for commercial use via the following methods:

* It has an in-house team of professional photographers who upload images across the different categories on the website.
* Freerange Stock also purchases image rights or directly commissions photos from independent creators.
* You can also contribute to the website's library by voluntarily submitting your work to the platform. Kindly note that you will need a verified account to enable this function.
* The website also works directly with photographers through a licensing and distribution model, providing them extra exposure on the site.
* Finally, Freerange stock aggregates public domain images from other sources, including similar sites and government institutions. It does so by acknowledging the image owner and sometimes lists the image source when the owner is unknown.

Freerange Stock is accessible through your web browser or as an API integration on your app.

### 4\. Vecteezy

![vecteezy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-5.jpg)

Vecteezy is an extensive online library of free stock images for commercial use. Some of the site's highlight features include the following:

* A best-in-class search engine that incorporates multiple filters to ensure your results are extremely accurate. For example, you can sort images by color, style, number of people, and age of the subjects, something other free stock websites do not provide.
* All images, videos, and vector illustrations are free for personal and commercial uses. It does so through a property sign and release model with its extensive network of contributors, which protects users from any legal liabilities.
* Finally, it employs a content team that manually reviews each photo submission to ensure consistent quality standards for its offerings.

In addition, you can also purchase design resource bundles by subscribing to its Vecteezy pro for as little as $9 monthly. Some of the resources available include the Ultimate Text Effects Layer Styles Bundle for Photoshop, which costs $39 stand-alone or $4.50 when you subscribe to pro.

## Part 2: Buy from stock providers

Another way to get images for commercial use is by buying them from stock providers. Some of the benefits of buying images from stock providers include:

* You get a wide selection of unique photos from top-tier photographers. Stock providers always seek collaborations with the industry's finest to edge out the competition.
* You receive exemplary customer service with your purchase. Selecting the right image can be confusing for amateur creators. As such, stock image providers have customer support channels to help you throughout your creative process.
* Stock images reduce your delivery times significantly. Buying images from a stock provider eliminates the need to invest in photography equipment and the time you need for post-production. As such, you can deliver projects in a fast and cost-effective way.

Despite the above positive, here are some challenges that buying stock images may present:

* Not all stock image providers will have the creative assets you need.
* Image overuse is likely since every creator will rush for the most popular contributor.

Below are some of the stock image providers you should consider.

### 1\. iStock

iStockphoto.com is an online database of creative resources, including royalty-free photos, videos, audio, illustrations, and clip art you can use in your creations. The website is a Getty Images subsidiary based in Calgary, Canada. In addition, contributors earn royalties depending on how often users download their content.

### 2\. Alamy.com

Alamy.com is a British-owned stock image provider with contributions from photographers and agencies in 173 countries. It compensates its contributors by offering higher than average payouts every time users download their creations. Some popular brands to use Alamy's services include M&C Saatchi, Microsoft, and The Economist.

## Part 3: Shot a Photo by yourself or create one with editing tools

Alternatively, you can get images for commercial use by shooting them yourself or creating them with editing tools such as Figma and Wondershare's Filmstock. Here are some benefits of using this method:

* You get exactly what you want, provided you have the required skills and equipment. Sometimes, getting the right image for your commercial purpose can be challenging. As such, shooting an original photo may be the only option.
* You have full ownership of the image.

Unlike obtaining images from stock photography websites, you are free to use the image in whatever capacity you please without any restrictions. For example, sites such as Unsplash do not allow you to use their images in political statements, a restriction you can bypass when using your own creations.

However, you should also consider the following factors when using this method.

### It requires a substantial investment

Getting high-quality images for commercial purposes requires specialist equipment. For example, the Panasonic LUMIX GH6 camera, which has 4K resolution capability, costs $2,197 on Amazon. This makes it extremely expensive for amateur creators.

### There is a steep learning curve

Becoming a professional photographer takes time and effort. Unless you are creating as a hobby, it will be a while before you can start generating income from your creations.

## Part 4: FAQs

### 1\. Do you need a contributor account to get images for commercial use?

Not necessarily. Stock image sites like pexels.com allow you to download images from their website without creating an account. You will only need one if you want to showcase your work on the platform.

### 2\. Can you use your smartphone to get images for commercial use?

Yes. Most stock image providers have device-specific apps that allow you to access their databases from your mobile device. For example, UnsplashPhotoPicker allows you access to the Unsplash library from your Android device.
