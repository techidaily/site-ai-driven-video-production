It contains thousands of free gaming apps in different categories like action, arcade, adventure, simulation, song games, and puzzle games. The download links are readily available; you can even access this site from your mobile by scanning a QR code. This site is a pretty good platform to download free games but has certain flaws. It does not allow a multiplayer gaming experience, and no customer services are provided.

#### 3 [Android Apps](https://androidapps.com/)

![android apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/android-apps.jpg)

It is another platform to download android apps for free. This site is pretty good since it updates games that developers handpick almost daily. You can also promote your app using the ‘promote your app’ feature. The site has a lot of updates and takes an unreasonable amount of time to install and update the software. Furthermore, you can say that they do not have a customer service function because nobody ever responds to the customer’s queries.

#### 4 [1 Mobile](http://www.1mobile.com/)
