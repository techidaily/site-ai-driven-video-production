Other interesting and new features include the [Green Screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Scene Detection options.

The newly added Action Cam Tool allows you to merge, cut and edit **4k videos shot** by your action cameras, smartphones or other 4k cameras in minutes.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora features the ability to import and edit 4K videos with ease. After launching Filmora, create a new project by clicking New Project in the Get Started window and then go to Project Settings to change the resolution to **3840 x 2160 (16:9 4K UHD)** or **4096 x 2160 (DCI 4K)** based on your need.

![ Filmora9 4K Project settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-4k-project-settings.jpg)

Not sure the differences between these two options, check our guide about [What is 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get a clue.

The default project setting is 1920 x 1080 (16:9 Full HD), if you didn’t set up the project settings at the beginning, Filmora will prompt up a window asking you to change the project settings to match the 4K video. You can click **Match to Media** to change the project settings quickly.

![ Filmora 9 change project settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-change-project-settings-match.jpg)

Editing 4K videos requires high computer performance, to avoid your computer overrunning, Filmora can [create proxy files](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to load the video in lower resolution during editing, but rending the final export video with the original full quality. You can also customize the playback quality of the 4K videos to half quality or even 1/6 quality for smoother editing.

![ Filmora 9 create proxy files ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-proxy-files.jpg)

When exporting to 4K Ultra High Definition Quality, just click the Settings button in the Export window to enter the Settings window to adjust the resolution to 3840 x 2160 or 4096 x 2160\. Besides, you can also change the frame rate and bit rate as well.

#### 2\. [iMovie](http://www.apple.com/imovie/)

If you are a Mac user and have iMovie 10.1 or version above, you can now edit 4K videos on your Mac with iMovie for free. iMovie is a free 4K video editing software for Mac. You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.

![ iMovie Project Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-project-editing-ineterface.jpg)

With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.

It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you'll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.

#### 3\. [CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra](http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1)

Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.

![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector> -ultra-19 interface.png)

It's hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don't want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.

This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.

#### 4\. [Vegas Pro](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro)

One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096\. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.

![Vegas Pro Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/VegasPro-18-interface.jpg)

Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony's intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.

The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)/ $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.

#### 5\. [Vegas Movie Studio](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO%5FS3%5FMOVIE%5FAX100)

At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony's fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.

Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.

#### 6\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe's Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe's software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe's cloud service.

The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.

The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.

#### 7\. [Apple Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/)

The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).

There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.

#### 8\. [MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021](http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/)

Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.

The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.

### Most Frequently Asked Questions about 4K Video Editor

#### 1\.  What is the best 4k video editor for Windows PC?

Each video editor listed above has its advantages over others. For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.

#### 2\.  Is there any free 4k video editor?

If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.

For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.

And if there are some other video editing software which is missed from the list, please leave a comment and let us know. But before you leave, do not forget to download and try our latest video editing software Filmora to edit your 4K video footage.

Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.

#### 6\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe's Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe's software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe's cloud service.

The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.

The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.

#### 7\. [Apple Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/)

The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).

There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.

#### 8\. [MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021](http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/)

Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.

The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.

### Most Frequently Asked Questions about 4K Video Editor

#### 1\.  What is the best 4k video editor for Windows PC?

Each video editor listed above has its advantages over others. For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.

#### 2\.  Is there any free 4k video editor?

If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.

For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.

And if there are some other video editing software which is missed from the list, please leave a comment and let us know. But before you leave, do not forget to download and try our latest video editing software Filmora to edit your 4K video footage.

![ Filmora 9  4K video Editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-filmora9-editing.jpg)

Cool effects include the particularly interesting Hollywood style effects, sound effects and stunning templates. Other interesting and new features include the [Green Screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Scene Detection options. The software can also automatically fix the footage with lighting or color issues which can result in a much more polished end result.

The newly added Action Cam Tool allows you to merge, cut and edit **4k videos shot** by your action cameras, smartphones or other 4k cameras in minutes.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora features the ability to import and edit 4K videos with ease. After launching Filmora, create a new project by clicking New Project in the Get Started window and then go to Project Settings to change the resolution to **3840 x 2160 (16:9 4K UHD)** or **4096 x 2160 (DCI 4K)** based on your need.

![ Filmora9 4K Project settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-4k-project-settings.jpg)

Not sure the differences between these two options, check our guide about [What is 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get a clue.

The default project setting is 1920 x 1080 (16:9 Full HD), if you didn’t set up the project settings at the beginning, Filmora will prompt up a window asking you to change the project settings to match the 4K video. You can click **Match to Media** to change the project settings quickly.

![ Filmora 9 change project settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-change-project-settings-match.jpg)

Editing 4K videos requires high computer performance, to avoid your computer overrunning, Filmora can [create proxy files](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to load the video in lower resolution during editing, but rending the final export video with the original full quality. You can also customize the playback quality of the 4K videos to half quality or even 1/6 quality for smoother editing.

![ Filmora 9 create proxy files ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-proxy-files.jpg)

When exporting to 4K Ultra High Definition Quality, just click the Settings button in the Export window to enter the Settings window to adjust the resolution to 3840 x 2160 or 4096 x 2160\. Besides, you can also change the frame rate and bit rate as well.

#### 2\. [iMovie](http://www.apple.com/imovie/)

If you are a Mac user and have iMovie 10.1 or version above, you can now edit 4K videos on your Mac with iMovie for free. iMovie is a free 4K video editing software for Mac. You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.

![ iMovie Project Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-project-editing-ineterface.jpg)

With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.

It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you'll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.

#### 3\. [CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra](http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1)

Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.

![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector> -ultra-19 interface.png)

It's hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don't want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.

This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.

#### 4\. [Vegas Pro](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro)

One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096\. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.

![Vegas Pro Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/VegasPro-18-interface.jpg)

Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony's intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.

The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)/ $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.

#### 5\. [Vegas Movie Studio](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO%5FS3%5FMOVIE%5FAX100)

At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony's fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.

If you are a Mac user and have iMovie 10.1 or version above, you can now edit 4K videos on your Mac with iMovie for free. iMovie is a free 4K video editing software for Mac. You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.

![ iMovie Project Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-project-editing-ineterface.jpg)

With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.

It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you'll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.

#### 3\. [CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra](http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1)

Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.

![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector> -ultra-19 interface.png)

It's hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don't want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.

This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.

#### 4\. [Vegas Pro](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro)

One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096\. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.

![Vegas Pro Editing Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/VegasPro-18-interface.jpg)

Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony's intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.

The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)/ $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.

#### 5\. [Vegas Movie Studio](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO%5FS3%5FMOVIE%5FAX100)

At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony's fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.

Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.

#### 6\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe's Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe's software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe's cloud service.

The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.

The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.

#### 7\. [Apple Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/)

The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).

There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.

#### 8\. [MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021](http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/)

Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.

The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.

### Most Frequently Asked Questions about 4K Video Editor

#### 1\.  What is the best 4k video editor for Windows PC?

Each video editor listed above has its advantages over others. For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.

#### 2\.  Is there any free 4k video editor?

If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.

For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.

And if there are some other video editing software which is missed from the list, please leave a comment and let us know. But before you leave, do not forget to download and try our latest video editing software Filmora to edit your 4K video footage.

# Best Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.

## Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad

Even though selecting a video collage app isn’t a very complicated process, there are still a number of factors you need to consider before you choose to install a video collage app on your iPad or iPhone. Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.

#### 1. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-collage-maker/id543577420)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 8 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

As its name suggests, this app allows you to create both photo and video collages. You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.

#### 2. [PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picplaypost-video-editor/id498127541)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.3 or later

![PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor - Video Collage Making App ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video. Adding text layers, recording voiceovers or creating soundtracks for your video collages are just a few options you’ll have at your disposal if you install the PicPlayPost movie video editor on your iOS-based device. In case you’re planning on using this app on a daily basis, you should consider purchasing the Everything Pack that costs just $24.99\.

#### 3. [PicStich](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pic-stitch-collage-editor/id454768104)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.0 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pic-stitch-collage-editor.jpg)

The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.

#### 4. [PhotoGrid - Pic Collage Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-pic-editor/id543577420)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

The app’s photo editing features are also remarkable which means that you can use the PhotoGrid app to manipulate images in any way you want.

#### 5. [PhotoVideo Collage Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photovideocollage-maker/id751270901?ls=1)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.2 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photovideocollage-maker.jpg)

Making a new video collage with PhotoVideo Collage Maker is a quick and simple process. You just have to pick a layout, arrange videos by dragging and dropping them to a preferred position and choose a frame for each video. The app features a rich collection frames and textures, and it even lets you use frames with curved edges that help your videos stand out. PhotoVideo Collage Maker enables you to import songs from your iTunes collection and allows you to control the volume of the videos or use the fade-in and fade-out effects. You can also choose if you want all the videos to play simultaneously or one after the other. Unlocking the app’s pro features will cost you $1.99, but making this investment is an excellent idea if you would like to use the PhotoVideo Collage Maker for professional purposes.

#### 6. [PicCollage Grid & Video Editor](https://apps.apple.com/bg/app/piccollage-grid-video-editor/id448639966)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.3 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PicCollage-grid-video-editor> .jpg)

Besides making video collages, you can also use the PicCollage Grid & Video Editor to create animated collages. The only downside is that all photo or video collages you create with the free version of the app are going to be watermarked.

#### 7. [VidStitch Frames for Instagram](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram/id712908978)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.0

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram.jpg)

VidsStitch was designed exclusively for iPhones and iPads, and it works best with the videos captured on these devices. The process of creating a new video collage can be completed in just a few quick steps. You should start by choosing one of the pre-designed frames, then you should just import and arrange your videos within the frame and decide whether you want to post the video collage on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook. The free version of VidStich is going to watermark all your creations and it won’t allow you to add music to your collages, which is why purchasing the Pro pack and additional frames and borders will help you produce visual content that is going to impress your followers on social media.

We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.

## Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad

Even though selecting a video collage app isn’t a very complicated process, there are still a number of factors you need to consider before you choose to install a video collage app on your iPad or iPhone. Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.

#### 1. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-collage-maker/id543577420)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 8 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

As its name suggests, this app allows you to create both photo and video collages. You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.

#### 2. [PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picplaypost-video-editor/id498127541)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.3 or later

![PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor - Video Collage Making App ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video. Adding text layers, recording voiceovers or creating soundtracks for your video collages are just a few options you’ll have at your disposal if you install the PicPlayPost movie video editor on your iOS-based device. In case you’re planning on using this app on a daily basis, you should consider purchasing the Everything Pack that costs just $24.99\.

#### 3. [PicStich](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pic-stitch-collage-editor/id454768104)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.0 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pic-stitch-collage-editor.jpg)

The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.

#### 4. [PhotoGrid - Pic Collage Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-pic-editor/id543577420)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

If you are looking for an app that lets you create stunning video collages in seconds, you should look no further. PhotoGrid app lets you combine multiple videos within a single frame while offering a plethora of video editing tools you can use to enhance each video in the collage. What’s more, the app features a rich font library, stickers, filters and transitions you can use to make each video collage look more authentic. There are hundreds of available layouts to choose from that let you merge up to fifteen separate video clips and more than 400 backgrounds that can fit almost any style of a video collage. The app’s photo editing features are also remarkable which means that you can use the PhotoGrid app to manipulate images in any way you want.

#### 5. [PhotoVideo Collage Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photovideocollage-maker/id751270901?ls=1)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.2 or later

Making a new video collage with PhotoVideo Collage Maker is a quick and simple process. You just have to pick a layout, arrange videos by dragging and dropping them to a preferred position and choose a frame for each video. The app features a rich collection frames and textures, and it even lets you use frames with curved edges that help your videos stand out. PhotoVideo Collage Maker enables you to import songs from your iTunes collection and allows you to control the volume of the videos or use the fade-in and fade-out effects. You can also choose if you want all the videos to play simultaneously or one after the other. Unlocking the app’s pro features will cost you $1.99, but making this investment is an excellent idea if you would like to use the PhotoVideo Collage Maker for professional purposes.

#### 6. [PicCollage Grid & Video Editor](https://apps.apple.com/bg/app/piccollage-grid-video-editor/id448639966)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

The app’s text editor lets change fonts, pick different text colors or change its alignment, while the cutout mode enables you to remove the background from your photos within seconds. Besides making video collages, you can also use the PicCollage Grid & Video Editor to create animated collages. The only downside is that all photo or video collages you create with the free version of the app are going to be watermarked.

#### 7. [VidStitch Frames for Instagram](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram/id712908978)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.0

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram.jpg)

The process of creating a new video collage can be completed in just a few quick steps. You should start by choosing one of the pre-designed frames, then you should just import and arrange your videos within the frame and decide whether you want to post the video collage on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook. The free version of VidStich is going to watermark all your creations and it won’t allow you to add music to your collages, which is why purchasing the Pro pack and additional frames and borders will help you produce visual content that is going to impress your followers on social media.

**Conclusion**

Presentation of the videos you record with your iPhone or iPad is as important as their overall quality. The video collage makers for iOS-based devices provide you with all the tools you’re going to need to create visually dynamic, entertaining and attention-grabbing video collages your followers on social media are going to enjoy watching.
