## 8 Best Video and Music Editor

#### 1. TikTok (including Musical.ly)

A short while ago TikTok and Musical.ly merged into a single app that lets you create lip-sync videos effortlessly. The app grants you access to a sizeable music library where you can find music from Pop, Rock or R&B genres, so you just have to browse through it and select the song you like and hit the Record button afterward. The TikTok's video editing features include easy-to-use cut and trim tools, duplicate video and merge options that allow you to have complete creative control over the footage you record.

In addition, you can add visual effects and stickers to your videos and if you decide to go live you'll be able to use some of the live streaming filters.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ best music video maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videofx-music-video-maker.jpg)

Making lip-sync videos with this app is easy, but you must use your own music since the Video FX Music Video Maker doesn't offer royalty free music library. You can either use an MP3 file or record your own voice to make the soundtrack for the video. The app offers advanced video recording options, so you can pause and resume shooting at any moment or use the Start Timer option to give yourself time to prepare before the recording starts. The newly added Stop Motion feature enables you to animate your music videos, while the Fast Motion recording mode allows you to speed up all movement in the video.

Focus on your performance and let the app do the rest for you. You can dance, sing or act goofy in your music videos and Triller will edit your videos automatically. If you want, you can also use the app's trim or cut tools to remove any part of the video clip you don't like. The only downside is that music videos you record with Triller can't last longer than 30 seconds.

The app's music collection includes some of the most popular songs at the moment, so you can even participate in different music challenges or create lip-sync videos with music from your favorite singers. Triller lets you draw over videos, apply different visual effects or add text overlays, but some of these features must be purchased, as the free version of the app offers only a limited amount of ways to edit music and video.

#### 4. Video Star

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-star/id438596432?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, monthly subscription: $4.99

The process of editing a video with Video Star is fun because you can trim or cut your videos, [clone yourself](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), make stop-motion animations or slow-motion videos. However, purchasing power packs, or opting for a monthly subscription is necessary if you want to gain access to all of the features the app has to offer. You can save your videos to your camera roll or share them to your social media accounts directly from the Video Star video editor.

#### 5. MuStar: Lipsync Musically Video Editor

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.qstudio.mustar&hl=en%5FUS), [Android](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mustar-lip-sync-musical-battle/id1179466049?mt=8)

![ best music video maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/music-video-maker-app.jpg)

Creating a great soundtrack with Music Video Maker is simple because you can just select a song and cut or trim the parts you don't want to use in the video. The app's video editor lets you apply effects, add frames and text overlays, while you can also import as many as sixty photos from your camera roll and turn them into an HD video.

However, the Music Video Maker is primarily a photo editor, which means that it lacks some of the frequently used effects that are commonly used in music videos that are posted on TikTok and other similar platforms. The app contains ads, which can slow you down during the video editing process. Despite all of these downsides, Music Video Maker app still offers powerful tools that enable its users to create music videos quickly.
