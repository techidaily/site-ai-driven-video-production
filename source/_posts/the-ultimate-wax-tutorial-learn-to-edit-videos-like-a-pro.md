Trimming the unnecessary parts of the video is the need of the hour. However, some people don't prefer downloading a tool for it. So, the following online video trimmers for windows 10 can assist them in their job:

### 2\. [Online Video Cutter](https://online-video-cutter.com/)

![online video cutter trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-video-cutter-trimmer.jpg)

Online Video Cutter allows you to trim easily, crop, and twist videos, as well as modify the playing speed. It functions in any browser — tested it in Safari on the Mac, which isn't frequently recognized by online tools, and it worked flawlessly – and the only restriction is that your file size cannot exceed 500MB.

You may export in MP4, MKV, or MOV format. It does not require any sign up from the user to trim the video and nor does it leave any watermark on the video after editing.

Features:

* Supports every kind of browser
* It does not leave any watermark
* Offers a quick no-encode alternative

### 3\. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/)

![kapwing trim video online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-trim-video-online.jpg)

Kapwing is a straightforward online video editor. It displays a preview of your video on the left side of the screen, and users can use the scales or timeouts to choose the start and finish times of their cut.

Kapwing is a premium service, which means free users can only upload files up to 250MB in size, and exports may only be 7 minutes long. There's no need to register yourself for editing the videos through Kapwing, but it does leave a watermark.

Features:

* Allows you to preview the video
* It is quite simple to use for editing
* It does not require any sign up before trimming

### 4\. [Adobe Creative Cloud Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/)

Adobe Creative Cloud Express is the best free online video trimmer windows 10 available for making simple modifications to videos. It enables the creation, editing, and sharing of new projects from any device. It recognizes original edit spots automatically and works with all AVI, MXF, and other file formats. Furthermore, the curve is managed automatically by this online video trimmer.

However, it needs registration to edit the video, and the free version leaves a watermark.

Features:

* It reformats the video automatically.
* It enables the editing platform to be expanded.
* It integrates with other apps and services without a hitch.

![adobe express trim video interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-express-trim-video-interface.jpg)

### 5\. [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/)

![clipchamp trim video online windows chrome](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clipchamp-trim-video-online-windows-chrome.jpg)

Clipchamp is a freemium service, which means it has a free tier, but the finest features are only available to paying users. Your video output is restricted to general standards at 480p quality.

Since Safari does not support Clipchamp, you must use the Chrome or Edge browser on a Mac. Users need to register themselves for editing the videos through Clipchamp. The free version also leaves a watermark on the video.

Features:

* Helps the user to add audio and video
* Lets you export the video to social media platforms
* Offers multiple editing features for the video

### 6\. [Clideo](https://clideo.com/cut-video)

Clideo provides several online tools for looping, flipping, reversing, and filtering video clips, adding subtitles, resizing clips, and creating memes. Each tool is a standalone application running in your internet browser.

There are file size restrictions while using the free version, i.e., 500MB or fewer files, as with other online services. A Pro subscription, which costs $9 per month, allows you access to the full version. Clideo does not need registration, but the free version leaves a watermark.

Features:

* Excellent editing features in the free version
* Helps you add subtitles to the video
* Allows you to compress/resize the video

#### 1. [Online Tone Generator](http://onlinetonegenerator.com/)

You can find a number of different options on this website that range from the Pitch Shifter that allows you to change the Pitch of the files you upload to the Online Tone Generator platform to Binaural Beats and DTMF Signals. After you land on the website’s homepage, you’ll be able to see a tone generator that lets you **select the frequency, volume and the waveform of a tone**. The frequency will be set to 44.1 kHz and the wave type will be set to **Sine by default**.

All sound files you can find on this platform are accurately calibrated, and you can adjust their frequency and amplitude. Clicking on any of the links available in the Tone Gen section of this website will take you to another page where you can adjust the properties of a tone before downloading it.

![ Online Tone Generator ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audiocheck-online-tone-genereatorso-sinetone.jpg)

In the upper left corner of the new webpage, you’ll be able to see the **Play** button that lets you hear the default tone you selected. Directly below you can find the File Generator option where you can adjust the properties of the tone you’re generating. The displayed options depend on the type of tone you selected. Clicking on the **Download** button will save the tone you generated to your computer, but you won’t be able to save a tone if you inserted an incorrect value into one of the boxes.

#### 3. [Szynalski Online Tone Generator](http://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/)

Making tones on this online platform doesn’t require any effort at all since you can easily control the frequency of the tone using a large slider that is displayed across the entire page. Clicking on the **Play** button will play the tone under the current settings so you can make the necessary adjustments if you’re not happy with the results you’re getting. Several options that let you fine-tune the settings of the tone you’re generating can be found below the frequency slider.

The **volume and balance** are located on the right side of the screen and they allow you to determine how loud the tone is going to be or to choose to which channel the majority of the signal is going to be sent. The value in the middle of the screen displays the current frequency of the tone. The arrows also allow you to change the frequency value, while clicking on the wave type selector lets you choose between Sawtooth, Sine, Triangle, and Square options.

The tones you generate on this website **can’t be downloaded to your computer**, but you can use the **Get Link option** to send a tone to your email or to a friend.

#### 4. [Wavtones Audio Frequency Signal Generator](https://www.wavtones.com/functiongenerator.php)

![ Online Tone Generator ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wavtones-online-tone-generator.jpg)

The **WavtonesAudio Frequency Signal Generator** allows you to alter the properties of each tone it offers, even if you’re using the free version, but you can’t listen to any of the available tones before you download them. This makes it a bit more difficult to generate a tone in accordance with your current demands. Furthermore, the **Bit Depth** of all tones the free version of this online tone generator provides is limited to 16-bit.

#### 5. [Gieson TonGen](https://www.gieson.com/Library/projects/utilities/tonegen/)

![ Online Tone Generator ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gieson-tone-generator.jpg)

Saving the tones you generate is not possible as Gieson TonGen website doesn’t offer this option. Using a link to send a tone you created is also not possible. This online tone generator is a perfect option if you’re looking for a way to quickly generate a tone directly from your web browser, but it can be hardly considered a great option if you want to generate a tone for professional purposes.

## Conclusion

The scope of options different online tone generators provide can vary. That is the reason why your decision which of the tone-generating tools we covered in this article you are going to use depends on the reason why you’re creating a tone.
