MacBook systems are known for their best graphics and cool display which makes them pretty much viable for video editing purposes. Hence making them the best fit for video editing tasks.

#### 2\. Is there a default video editor on Mac?

iMovie is Apple's free and built-in video editor which is available right inside the Apple store and you need to activate it if you're a new user of MacBook.

#### 3\. Is Final Cut Pro for Mac only?
