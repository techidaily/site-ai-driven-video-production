If you will watch the video on a desktop, it will be cropped from the sides, or the top or bottom.

## Part 2 Useful Tips for a Wonderful Cover Video

To make sure that your cover video is interesting, engaging, and uploaded in a hassle-free manner, below listed are some useful tips

**●** Optimizing the video for the mobile phone users: Several times your video may run smoothly on your system but may have issues while playing on a mobile phone. So, keep your texts and important content within the specified size so that even if the video is cropped it does not look awkward.

**●** Go for prompt action: It is always better to get the CTA opportunities whenever available. When something specific is required from a video like increasing traffic, adding more clients, and similar others, let the video prompt to do that and avoid adding too much text.

**●** Audio is not very critical: Though audio can be added to the cover video, it does not have much relevance to the content you wish to showcase to the viewer. By default, the videos on Facebook are muted and also around 85% of the videos are watched without the sound.

**●** Keep the focus on one visual: A Facebook page is already too crowded and thus avoids loading the cover video with too much content. Focus on a single visual which can be text, image, CTA, or other depending on your purpose.

**●** Keep a natural loop: The video will be played on a loop continuously and thus to make it look appealing the starting and the ending should be smooth.

**●** Keeping the right size: Keeping the recommended **Facebook cover page video size** is important to make the video appear without any distortion, borders, or cropping.

## Part 3 Popular Facebook Cover Video Examples and Templates

A wide range of readymade templates to create cover videos are available. Using one of these templates, an impressive video can be created in no time. Some of the popular ones can be checked as below.

**●** Marketing cover video: To grab the attention of the clients, the marketing videos have to be bright and polished. So, if you too want to create one for your brand or business this template can be used.

**●** Cover video for new business: If you are launching a new business offering some products or services, this template will let you create an interesting video. Using this template, an introduction to your business can be given.

**●** Cover videos showreels: If you are into real-estate or fashion-related brands, a showreel video is a good option to be used as a cover video. The showreel of an event, behind-the-stage clips, tours, and similar others can be created.

**●** Event Promotion cover video:Promotion of an event through a cover video is a good option and this can be used for different purposes like fashion shows, open house tours, online sessions, webinars, and more. You can also create your event cover video using this template.

**●** Cover video to narrate a story: Narrating a story through a cover video is also a good way for promoting your business and especially if it is related to home décor, makeovers, travel, adventure, and similar others.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Found a video on Instagram with audio that you really like? Well, then it's easy enough to get your hand on it (so long as you don't intend to make use of it nefariously, of course!)

**●** There are Instagram-to-MP3 converters that will allow you to literally convert your favorite Instagram videos into an MP3 in a single click (without having to ever even download or install anything!)

**●** Although, of course, if you're looking for something more advanced than you're average, online video converter tool, there are other more premium options that you can try out to step up your game.
