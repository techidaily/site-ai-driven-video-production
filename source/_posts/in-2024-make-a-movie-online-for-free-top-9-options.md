## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

GIFs are basically soundless picture collections that have been modified to resemble a video. On the other hand, videos are gathered as a kind of rich media that includes both motion and sound. What's more, the viewing experiences for these two file kinds are somewhat different.

## But why would someone want to convert a video to a GIF, to begin with? There are several explanations for this

### GIFs are inexpensive

When converting a video to a GIF, you're repurposing existing material to create something new. Why not get the most out of your video marketing strategy?

### GIFs are simple to create

You don't need to be a video expert in producing a GIF. Creating a GIF using one of the video-to-GIF converters listed below may take a few minutes.

### GIFs are simple to use

GIFs offer motion and excitement to digital information without needing the viewer to devote a significant amount of time and attention - a significant advantage given the typical human attention span of roughly 8 seconds.

### GIFs are effective

When Dell executed a GIF-centric marketing campaign, it experienced a 109 percent boost in sales, indicating that consumers appreciate (and react to) this basic but fascinating medium. Check out these video-to-GIF converters below to pick the best one for you.

## 14 Best Video Splitter for Windows/Mac

### 1\. Filmora

You may quickly create a classic GIF picture as an output using Wondershare Filmora's interactive platform. All common video file types, such as MKV, WMV, AVI, and MP4, are supported. The greatest thing is that Filmora does not impose any file size restrictions during conversion so that users may convert HD films to GIF graphics.

It's a powerful image editor with many appealing features that allow you to personalize your picture completely. To create original GIFs, feel free to use complex components, animations, text, overlays, and so on.

In addition, Filmora enables you to extract still photos from videos of the same resolution. The retrieved PNG pictures may be combined and edited to create an intriguing GIF.

### Choosing software to save a video as a GIF

All operating systems have a way to convert video to GIF, as you can see in this article. All you have to do now is choose the right one. In a nutshell, here's how you choose the right platform for your GIFs:

**Usability:**The video to GIF platform you use should be simple to use. You want a high-performance converter that's also simple to use.

**Tools:** The platform should have all of the tools you'll need to make an intriguing GIF, such as speed modification, filters, subtitles, and more.

**Quality:** To avoid pixelation, your platform must be able to make GIFs with a high resolution.

**Speed:**Because you don't want to waste time waiting for your file to save, the speed at which the video converts to GIF is also significant.

## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

GIFs are basically soundless picture collections that have been modified to resemble a video. On the other hand, videos are gathered as a kind of rich media that includes both motion and sound. What's more, the viewing experiences for these two file kinds are somewhat different.
