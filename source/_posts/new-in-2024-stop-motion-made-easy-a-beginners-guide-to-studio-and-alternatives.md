## Part 3: How to Make Stop Motion Videos from Videos Online

![ kapwing stop motion maker export & share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker-export.jpg)

Afterward, you can choose to download, edit or share the video on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter.

# How to Split/Cut/Trim AVI Files Easily

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Splitting files is usually pretty simple, but things can get more complex if the files contain unwanted or unnecessary elements. Avi videos are usually large because they come with a lower compression ratio which retains the quality to a great extent. If you want to split the AVI files to reduce their file size so they can be a bit more easily shared or stored.
