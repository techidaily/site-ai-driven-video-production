 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

One of the most commonly sought bits of video-editing knowledge is the ability to blur the face in videos, whether for **privacy reasons**, artistic effect, or whatever sort of thing you’re going for. You can go wild once you learn how to **blur certain parts of a video**, and this is something that, in our opinion, every aspiring video editor should learn how to do.

Now there are hundreds of video editing software, and every video editor has his own personal choice when it comes to choosing the right tool for the job. Our list focuses on what are, in our opinion, the most accessible and efficient NLE’s on the market.

#### 1. Blur Face with Filmora Video Editor \[with Faceoff / Mosaic\]

**[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is a favorite among many amateur video editors because the free version is robust by itself and features most of what one would need when not dealing with professional projects. It is available for both **macOS** and **Windows**.

**How to Blur the Faces in Filmora:**

* Double click the video clip applied Mosaic effect in the timeline to enter the video effects tab, in where you can dictate the size of the area, the mosaic types, and also adjust the opacity.
* If the image is in motion and you’d like the blurred area to be mobile as well, drag the **Face Off** from the Effects tab to the timeline and adjust it in the Video Effects tab as well. You can pick the face-off pattern under Video Effects and the Face-off feature will tracks the face that appears on the screen and applies a blur to it.

#### 2. Using YouTube Video Enhancements to Blur Faces

Those interested in learning how to [blur faces in videos in order to apply the trick to their **You** **Tube** videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) will find the fact that you can do this through the Video Enhancements section of your **Creator Studios** dashboard quite convenient. This addition is something that has been introduced in 2006 and has been well received by the community.

**How to Blur the Faces with YouTube Enhancement tool:**

* Sign in your YouTube account and select the **Creator** **Studio** option after clicking the avatar. Locate the video that you want to edit and access video **Enhancements**.
* You will see two blurring options in the **Enhancement** window: **Blur faces** and **Custom blurring**. To blur all faces appear in the video, go to **Blur faces** and click **Edit**

![ blur faces](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-face-in-youtube-enhancement.jpg)

After you’re finished the editing, click **Save** to save the edits in-place, or **Save as New Video**, which creates a new video (this would mean, however, that you would lose any views you previously had).

![ blur faces](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-enhancement-save.jpg)

#### 4. Blur face with Adobe Premiere Pro CC professional video editor

**Premiere Pro CC** is Adobe’s dedicated video editing software. There are many video editors out there that have some experience in Photoshop as well, and since there’s a chance they work in Premiere Pro CC due to how similar the UI of both of these products is, we’ve decided to give this NLE some attention as well. Available for both **MacOS** and **Windows**.

**How to Blur the Faces in Premiere Pro?**

1. **Select** the video clip in the timeline.
2. Access the **Effects** tab, and then click **Video Effects,** and then **Stylize**.
3. Click **Mosaic**.
4. Go to the **Effects Control** tab, and pick the shape of blurred area. The elliptical and 4-point polygon mask options are what most people use when blurring faces in particular.
5. Drag the **Mask** over the intended area
6. Adjust **Positioning**, **Scale**, **and**/**or Rotation** to your liking.
7. You can fine-tune the effect further by adjusting the **Mask Expansion,** the **Horizontal and Vertical** blocks the mosaic effect is composed of, and the **Feather**

What sort of video editing software you go for when you want to edit the face in videos is ultimately up to you - we’ve only expressed our personal preferences in the hopes that it might help some of the people that are interested in the subject. Most of the steps present in this list are similar to each other and you will find that once you learn how to do this trick, you will become far more familiarized with all the various effects available to you.
