What to do to solve the issue or if there exists some solution? Let’s take a look over some of the reasons due to which Amazon Prime Video widescreen does not appear as required:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some of the devices do not support particular resolution videos.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>

Pexels offers an impressive collection of free public domain stock videos, so you just have to insert a search term and pick a video clip that best fits your needs. The duration of the free videos you can find on Pexels rarely exceeds thirty seconds, which makes it difficult to make an entire video exclusively from free public domain stock footage.

<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>

<p><strong>Free public domain stock footage</strong> can be used on different types of projects, and it is usually a great choice if you’re looking for some extra shots that will make a scene in your video more cinematic. Pexels offers an impressive collection of free public domain stock videos, so you just have to insert a search term and pick a video clip that best fits your needs. The duration of the free videos you can find on Pexels rarely exceeds thirty seconds, which makes it difficult to make an entire video exclusively from free public domain stock footage. Hence it is better to use Pexels as a complementary source of shots in case you can’t go back to the filming location.</p>

<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video-2"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos-2"><a href="#Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos"></a>Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos</h2><p><strong>Finding free public domain footage or public movies</strong> on the Internet has never been too difficult, as you can watch thousands of public domain movies on YouTube, but you cannot download them. Over the course of the last couple of decades, the websites where you can <strong>download public domain footage</strong> have grown in number, which makes it somewhat easier to find the video clips you can use in your projects for free. Here are some of the best online destinations where you can <strong>download public domain videos</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="1-Prelinger-Archive-2"><a href="#1-Prelinger-Archive-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

                ></p>
<p>With more than 17,000 items in the collection, the Prelinger Archive is probably one of the largest public domain video libraries on the Internet. The archive was founded in 1983 by Rick Prelinger, but by 2002 it became a part of the Library of Congress Motion Picture Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Divison’s collection. You can <strong>download public domain video clips</strong> created by educational institutions, advertising companies, trade associations or corporations from this impressive collection. There are different download options available for each file, so you can choose the size of a file and the method you’re going to use to download a file to your computer.</p>

<p>This is an excellent resource for researchers looking for essays, books, audio recordings, images or old films. The movies are divided into different categories such as Animals&amp;Beasts, Politics, War or Sports which makes locating and <strong>downloading public domain videos</strong> faster and easier. The Public Domain Review offers footage that is available within different public domain licenses, so you must make sure that the film you want to download can be used for the purpose you have in mind. The vast majority of the films in this archive are from the last decade of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. That’s why The Public Domain Review’s selection of films can only be useful if you are researching a topic from that era.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The National Screening Room is a project created by the Library of Congress National Audio-Visual Conservation Center with the aim of making the videos from their collection available to the viewers around the world. The vast majority of the videos in the collection were filmed during the 20th century, but there are only a few videos available that are produced outside of the United States. The National Screening Room can be a valuable asset if you are looking for videos you can use for educational or research videos that cover topics that range from the development of the arms industry to the daily life of great American inventors.</p>

<p>Industry professionals don’t need an introduction to the Pond5 platform, because it is probably the largest online marketplace for royalty-free media at the moment. Their Public Domain Project contains a thousand public videos that can be downloaded for free, but the duration of these videos is limited to just two minutes To make things worse, most of these public domain videos don’t have audio, so you can only use them if you already have a soundtrack for the video you’re making. The platform offers powerful search tools that enable you to look for videos based on different parameters. You can download public domain videos in HD resolution, but you must create an account on Pond5 before you can save them to your computer.</p>

<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video-3"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos-3"><a href="#Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos"></a>Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos</h2><p><strong>Finding free public domain footage or public movies</strong> on the Internet has never been too difficult, as you can watch thousands of public domain movies on YouTube, but you cannot download them. Over the course of the last couple of decades, the websites where you can <strong>download public domain footage</strong> have grown in number, which makes it somewhat easier to find the video clips you can use in your projects for free. Here are some of the best online destinations where you can <strong>download public domain videos</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="1-Prelinger-Archive-3"><a href="#1-Prelinger-Archive-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

                ></p>
<p>With more than 17,000 items in the collection, the Prelinger Archive is probably one of the largest public domain video libraries on the Internet. The archive was founded in 1983 by Rick Prelinger, but by 2002 it became a part of the Library of Congress Motion Picture Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Divison’s collection. You can <strong>download public domain video clips</strong> created by educational institutions, advertising companies, trade associations or corporations from this impressive collection. There are different download options available for each file, so you can choose the size of a file and the method you’re going to use to download a file to your computer.</p>

<p>This is an excellent resource for researchers looking for essays, books, audio recordings, images or old films. The movies are divided into different categories such as Animals&amp;Beasts, Politics, War or Sports which makes locating and <strong>downloading public domain videos</strong> faster and easier. The Public Domain Review offers footage that is available within different public domain licenses, so you must make sure that the film you want to download can be used for the purpose you have in mind. The vast majority of the films in this archive are from the last decade of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. That’s why The Public Domain Review’s selection of films can only be useful if you are researching a topic from that era.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The National Screening Room is a project created by the Library of Congress National Audio-Visual Conservation Center with the aim of making the videos from their collection available to the viewers around the world. The vast majority of the videos in the collection were filmed during the 20th century, but there are only a few videos available that are produced outside of the United States. The National Screening Room can be a valuable asset if you are looking for videos you can use for educational or research videos that cover topics that range from the development of the arms industry to the daily life of great American inventors.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Industry professionals don’t need an introduction to the Pond5 platform, because it is probably the largest online marketplace for royalty-free media at the moment. Their Public Domain Project contains a thousand public videos that can be downloaded for free, but the duration of these videos is limited to just two minutes To make things worse, most of these public domain videos don’t have audio, so you can only use them if you already have a soundtrack for the video you’re making. The platform offers powerful search tools that enable you to look for videos based on different parameters. You can download public domain videos in HD resolution, but you must create an account on Pond5 before you can save them to your computer.</p>

<p><strong>Free public domain stock footage</strong> can be used on different types of projects, and it is usually a great choice if you’re looking for some extra shots that will make a scene in your video more cinematic. Pexels offers an impressive collection of free public domain stock videos, so you just have to insert a search term and pick a video clip that best fits your needs. The duration of the free videos you can find on Pexels rarely exceeds thirty seconds, which makes it difficult to make an entire video exclusively from free public domain stock footage. Hence it is better to use Pexels as a complementary source of shots in case you can’t go back to the filming location.</p>
<h4 id="6-Vidsplay-3"><a href="#6-Vidsplay-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

The only condition to use the stock footage on private or commercial projects for free is to credit the Vidsplay platform in the end credits, on the website or in the description of the videos you upload to your social media channels. All stock videos on Vidsplay are available in HD or 4K resolution, and you simply have to click on the Download button below a particular video to save it.</p>

You can also use PublicDomainFootage to research a particular topic and request content that is not uploaded to the website. You can <strong>download a public domain video</strong> after you pay a one time fee that enables you to use that video as many times as you want. The platform’s YouTube channel provides an easy way of searching for public domain videos you are going to use in your next documentary film.</p>
<h4 id="9-NASA’s-Video-Gallery-3"><a href="#9-NASA’s-Video-Gallery-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

Like all other government institutions, NASA is obligated by the law to offer all images and videos to the public domain. This means that all content you download from their website is free to use. Simply insert the search term and browse the results until you find the video clip you want to save to your computer. However, most public domain videos you can download from NASA’s website last only a couple of minutes.</p>

Categories like Cityscape, Animals or Water contain hundreds of stock videos, so you just have to open one of the available categories and locate the video clip you want to download. However, you must first create an account on Motion Elements before you can save video files to your computer. In addition, the platform doesn’t allow you to make more than five downloads per week and you must invite your friends to join the platform if you want to increase the weekly number of downloads. Even so, Motion Elements is a great source of stock footage you can use without any restrictions.</p>

Crediting the author or providing the source from which you acquired the footage will reduce the likelihood of legal complications. The public domain videos that feature famous actors or third party intellectual property can also be a subject of legal disputes, which is why it is better to avoid using them on commercial projects.</p>

Respecting the terms of the license under which a video is protected is of utmost importance, since failing to properly credit the author of the video, for instance, can have legal consequences. There are several different types of Creative Commons licenses and you must find out which one covers the video you’d like to use, before publishing your video. You can find more information about Creative Commons licenses at the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/" >FAQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Public domain videos cover very different topics, which means that the nature of your project determines the source from which you’ll acquire the footage. If you are researching the early days of cinema, then you’ll have no trouble downloading the public domain videos, but if the topic you’re exploring is more contemporary, finding the content you can use without any restrictions can prove to be troublesome.

<h5 id="Benjamin-Arango"><a href="#Benjamin-Arango" class="headerlink" title="Benjamin Arango"></a>Benjamin Arango</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p>A very simple, yet very effective effect is changing the speed of a video clip. This could be a simple still-frame (also called “Freeze Frame”) or playing a clip in slow or fast motion.</p>
<p>This article shows you how to do this using Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p>For more tutorials on slow-motion please refer to this article: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Slow Motion Video Editing Software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

STILL FRAMES"></a>1.  STILL FRAMES</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed001.jpg"
                      alt="still frames"
                ></p>
<p>A still-frame freezes action. For instance, here is a clip of a hummingbird getting ready to land on a bird feeder. I want to create a freeze-frame of the bird in flight. (Um, yeah, I use “freeze-frame” and “still-frame” interchangeably.)</p>
<p>In Final Cut Pro X, put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to freeze and type Option+F.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed002.jpg"
                      alt="freeze frames"
                ></p>
<p>This creates a two-second freeze-frame at the position of the playhead.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed003.jpg"
                      alt="create freeze frame"
                ></p>
<p>Adjust the duration of the frame by trimming the edge; just like any other clip. Here, for example, I’m making the duration of the freeze-frame 11 frames shorter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed004.jpg"
                      alt="freeze frames in FCP X"
                ></p>
<p>In case you were wondering, this is what the freeze looks like. It freezes the flight of the hummingbird in the middle of playback, allowing us to add graphics or other text then resume the action as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Very cool, except….</p>
<p>Well, the good news is that this is fast and easy. The bad news is that we can’t change the location of the still frame.</p>
<p>So, here’s another way to do this.</p>
<p>Put the playhead (or skimmer, but I prefer the playhead) on the frame you want to freeze, select the clip, then type Shift+F.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed005.jpg"
                      alt="Playhead"
                ></p>
<p>This locates the source clip in the Browser, selects both the Browser and the clip, and matches the position of the In, Out, and playhead.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed006.jpg"
                      alt="match clips"
                ></p>
<p>Now, with the Browser selected, type Option+F. This creates a freeze-frame of the Browser clip and places it at the location of the playhead as a connected clip in the Timeline.</p>
<p>As a connected clip, we can move this new freeze-frame wherever we want. However, be careful in moving the clip, because, unless you mark the original frame with a marker (type “M”), there’s no easy way to match the still frame with the source frame, once the still frame is moved somewhere else.</p>
<p>I use both these techniques in many different projects.</p>
<h4 id="2-HOLD-FRAME"><a href="#2-HOLD-FRAME" class="headerlink" title="2.  HOLD FRAME"></a>2.  HOLD FRAME</h4><p>A Hold Frame is similar to an in-line still frame, but with more flexibility.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hold frame"
                ></p>
<p>Put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to hold. Then, Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf-on-a-headset” Toolbar icon, choose Hold Frame (or type: Shift+H).</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>This displays the orange Retime editor bar above the clip, with a small red portion indicating the Hold frame.</p>

                      alt="create hold frames"
                ></p>
<p>Change the duration of the Hold frame by dragging the small thumb at the right end of the red bar.</p>
<p><img

<p>To change the actual frame being held, double-click the bar icon to the LEFT of the red Hold section and choose Source Frame (Edit). This allows you to slide the Hold frame selection left or right.</p>
<p>NOTE: Changing the source frame is a feature that I like a LOT!</p>
<h4 id="3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION"><a href="#3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION" class="headerlink" title="3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION"></a>3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION</h4><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed007.jpg" alt="fast/slow motion"></p>
<p>We use slow-motion to show events that are too fast for the unaided eye to see. And fast motion to speed up very slow events. Both of these effects use what’s called a “constant speed change,” where the entire clip changes by the same amount - either faster or slower.</p>
<p>WE create either effect using the same tools, just different values. Here’s how.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed008.jpg"
                      alt="slow motion"
                ></p>
<p>Select the clip who’s speed you want to change. Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” Toolbar icon, select Slow (or Fast).</p>
<p>Choose one of the available speeds; in this case, 50%. (Yes, you can change this to any value you want, I’ll show you how in a minute.)</p>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed009.jpg" alt="create slow/fast motion"></p>
<p>Three things happen at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>The duration of the clip changes</li>
<li>The orange Retiming bar appears over the top of the clip</li>
<li>The speed of the clip changes</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed010.jpg"
                      alt="speed010"
                ></p>
<p>To reset the speed back to normal (100%), click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Normal (100%).</p>
<p>There are two ways to change the speed of a clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed017.jpg"
                      alt="speed017"
                ></p>
<p>The easy way is to grab the small handle at the end of the clip and drag left or right. The speed will change as you drag it.</p>
<p>Or, for more precision, click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Custom.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed011.jpg"
                      alt="speed011"
                ></p>
<p>This opens a new dialog allowing a number of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse. Plays the clip in reverse.</li>
<li>Rate. Select a specific speed change as a percentage of normal speed for a clip. Less than 100% is slow-motion. More than 100% is fast-motion.</li>
<li>Duration. Select a specific duration for a clip and FCP X will calculate how fast or slow it needs to go.</li>
<li>Ripple. When checked, adjusts the duration of a clip based upon the speed. When unchecked, the clip duration remains fixed even when speed changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the smoothest speed changes when the percentage you choose divides evenly into 200. For example, 100, 66, 50, 40, 33, 25, 20, 10 and so on.</p>
<h4 id="4-EXTRA-CREDIT"><a href="#4-EXTRA-CREDIT" class="headerlink" title="4.  EXTRA CREDIT"></a>4.  EXTRA CREDIT</h4><p>There is one more setting to consider when slowing a clip. (This does not apply when creating fast motion.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed012.jpg"
                      alt="speed012"
                ></p>
<p>Using, again, either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” menu, select Video Quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal. This is the best choice for speeds of 50% or faster.</li>
<li>Frame Blending. This is the best choice for speeds of about 20% to 50%.</li>
<li>Optical Flow. This is the best choice for speeds slower than about 20%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frame blending puts a short dissolve between frames when running in slow motion to improve the illusion of motion. Optical Flow invents in-between frames to minimize the jerkiness of extremely slow motion.</p>
<p>Frame blending is relatively fast and easy. Optical Flow will look better in most cases, but takes a long time to render.</p>

<p>A very simple, yet very effective effect is changing the speed of a video clip. This could be a simple still-frame (also called “Freeze Frame”) or playing a clip in slow or fast motion.</p>
<p>This article shows you how to do this using Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p>For more tutorials on slow-motion please refer to this article: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Slow Motion Video Editing Software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

STILL FRAMES"></a>1.  STILL FRAMES</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed001.jpg"
                      alt="still frames"
                ></p>
<p>A still-frame freezes action. For instance, here is a clip of a hummingbird getting ready to land on a bird feeder. I want to create a freeze-frame of the bird in flight. (Um, yeah, I use “freeze-frame” and “still-frame” interchangeably.)</p>
<p>In Final Cut Pro X, put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to freeze and type Option+F.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed002.jpg"
                      alt="freeze frames"
                ></p>
<p>This creates a two-second freeze-frame at the position of the playhead.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed003.jpg"
                      alt="create freeze frame"
                ></p>
<p>Adjust the duration of the frame by trimming the edge; just like any other clip. Here, for example, I’m making the duration of the freeze-frame 11 frames shorter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed004.jpg"
                      alt="freeze frames in FCP X"
                ></p>
<p>In case you were wondering, this is what the freeze looks like. It freezes the flight of the hummingbird in the middle of playback, allowing us to add graphics or other text then resume the action as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Very cool, except….</p>
<p>Well, the good news is that this is fast and easy. The bad news is that we can’t change the location of the still frame.</p>
<p>So, here’s another way to do this.</p>
<p>Put the playhead (or skimmer, but I prefer the playhead) on the frame you want to freeze, select the clip, then type Shift+F.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed005.jpg"
                      alt="Playhead"
                ></p>
<p>This locates the source clip in the Browser, selects both the Browser and the clip, and matches the position of the In, Out, and playhead.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed006.jpg"
                      alt="match clips"
                ></p>
<p>Now, with the Browser selected, type Option+F. This creates a freeze-frame of the Browser clip and places it at the location of the playhead as a connected clip in the Timeline.</p>
<p>As a connected clip, we can move this new freeze-frame wherever we want. However, be careful in moving the clip, because, unless you mark the original frame with a marker (type “M”), there’s no easy way to match the still frame with the source frame, once the still frame is moved somewhere else.</p>
<p>I use both these techniques in many different projects.</p>
<h4 id="2-HOLD-FRAME-1"><a href="#2-HOLD-FRAME-1" class="headerlink" title="2.  HOLD FRAME"></a>2.  HOLD FRAME</h4><p>A Hold Frame is similar to an in-line still frame, but with more flexibility.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed013.jpg"
                      alt="hold frame"
                ></p>
<p>Put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to hold. Then, Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf-on-a-headset” Toolbar icon, choose Hold Frame (or type: Shift+H).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed014.jpg"
                      alt="hold frames in fcp x"
                ></p>
<p>This displays the orange Retime editor bar above the clip, with a small red portion indicating the Hold frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed015.jpg"
                      alt="create hold frames"
                ></p>
<p>Change the duration of the Hold frame by dragging the small thumb at the right end of the red bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="speed016"
                ></p>
<p>Add a speed ramp transition at the end of the Hold frame by clicking the downward-pointing arrow next to the word “Hold” in the Retime Editor.</p>
<p><img

<p>A very simple, yet very effective effect is changing the speed of a video clip. This could be a simple still-frame (also called “Freeze Frame”) or playing a clip in slow or fast motion.</p>
<p>This article shows you how to do this using Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p>For more tutorials on slow-motion please refer to this article: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Slow Motion Video Editing Software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed001.jpg"
                      alt="still frames"
                ></p>
<p>A still-frame freezes action. For instance, here is a clip of a hummingbird getting ready to land on a bird feeder. I want to create a freeze-frame of the bird in flight. (Um, yeah, I use “freeze-frame” and “still-frame” interchangeably.)</p>
<p>In Final Cut Pro X, put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to freeze and type Option+F.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed002.jpg"
                      alt="freeze frames"
                ></p>
<p>This creates a two-second freeze-frame at the position of the playhead.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed003.jpg"
                      alt="create freeze frame"
                ></p>
<p>Adjust the duration of the frame by trimming the edge; just like any other clip. Here, for example, I’m making the duration of the freeze-frame 11 frames shorter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed004.jpg"
                      alt="freeze frames in FCP X"
                ></p>
<p>In case you were wondering, this is what the freeze looks like. It freezes the flight of the hummingbird in the middle of playback, allowing us to add graphics or other text then resume the action as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Very cool, except….</p>
<p>Well, the good news is that this is fast and easy. The bad news is that we can’t change the location of the still frame.</p>
<p>So, here’s another way to do this.</p>
<p>Put the playhead (or skimmer, but I prefer the playhead) on the frame you want to freeze, select the clip, then type Shift+F.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed005.jpg"
                      alt="Playhead"
                ></p>
<p>This locates the source clip in the Browser, selects both the Browser and the clip, and matches the position of the In, Out, and playhead.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed006.jpg"
                      alt="match clips"
                ></p>
<p>Now, with the Browser selected, type Option+F. This creates a freeze-frame of the Browser clip and places it at the location of the playhead as a connected clip in the Timeline.</p>
<p>As a connected clip, we can move this new freeze-frame wherever we want. However, be careful in moving the clip, because, unless you mark the original frame with a marker (type “M”), there’s no easy way to match the still frame with the source frame, once the still frame is moved somewhere else.</p>
<p>I use both these techniques in many different projects.</p>
<h4 id="2-HOLD-FRAME-2"><a href="#2-HOLD-FRAME-2" class="headerlink" title="2.  HOLD FRAME"></a>2.  HOLD FRAME</h4><p>A Hold Frame is similar to an in-line still frame, but with more flexibility.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed013.jpg"
                      alt="hold frame"
                ></p>
<p>Put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to hold. Then, Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf-on-a-headset” Toolbar icon, choose Hold Frame (or type: Shift+H).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed014.jpg"
                      alt="hold frames in fcp x"
                ></p>
<p>This displays the orange Retime editor bar above the clip, with a small red portion indicating the Hold frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed015.jpg"
                      alt="create hold frames"
                ></p>
<p>Change the duration of the Hold frame by dragging the small thumb at the right end of the red bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed016.jpg"
                      alt="speed016"
                ></p>
<p>Add a speed ramp transition at the end of the Hold frame by clicking the downward-pointing arrow next to the word “Hold” in the Retime Editor.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed018.jpg"
                      alt="speed018"
                ></p>
<p>To change the actual frame being held, double-click the bar icon to the LEFT of the red Hold section and choose Source Frame (Edit). This allows you to slide the Hold frame selection left or right.</p>
<p>NOTE: Changing the source frame is a feature that I like a LOT!</p>
<h4 id="3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION-2"><a href="#3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION-2" class="headerlink" title="3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION"></a>3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION</h4><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed007.jpg" alt="fast/slow motion"></p>
<p>We use slow-motion to show events that are too fast for the unaided eye to see. And fast motion to speed up very slow events. Both of these effects use what’s called a “constant speed change,” where the entire clip changes by the same amount - either faster or slower.</p>
<p>WE create either effect using the same tools, just different values. Here’s how.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed008.jpg"
                      alt="slow motion"
                ></p>
<p>Select the clip who’s speed you want to change. Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” Toolbar icon, select Slow (or Fast).</p>
<p>Choose one of the available speeds; in this case, 50%. (Yes, you can change this to any value you want, I’ll show you how in a minute.)</p>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed009.jpg" alt="create slow/fast motion"></p>
<p>Three things happen at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>The duration of the clip changes</li>
<li>The orange Retiming bar appears over the top of the clip</li>
<li>The speed of the clip changes</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed010.jpg"
                      alt="speed010"
                ></p>
<p>To reset the speed back to normal (100%), click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Normal (100%).</p>
<p>There are two ways to change the speed of a clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed017.jpg"
                      alt="speed017"
                ></p>
<p>The easy way is to grab the small handle at the end of the clip and drag left or right. The speed will change as you drag it.</p>
<p>Or, for more precision, click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Custom.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed011.jpg"
                      alt="speed011"
                ></p>
<p>This opens a new dialog allowing a number of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse. Plays the clip in reverse.</li>
<li>Rate. Select a specific speed change as a percentage of normal speed for a clip. Less than 100% is slow-motion. More than 100% is fast-motion.</li>
<li>Duration. Select a specific duration for a clip and FCP X will calculate how fast or slow it needs to go.</li>
<li>Ripple. When checked, adjusts the duration of a clip based upon the speed. When unchecked, the clip duration remains fixed even when speed changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the smoothest speed changes when the percentage you choose divides evenly into 200. For example, 100, 66, 50, 40, 33, 25, 20, 10 and so on.</p>
<h4 id="4-EXTRA-CREDIT-2"><a href="#4-EXTRA-CREDIT-2" class="headerlink" title="4.  EXTRA CREDIT"></a>4.  EXTRA CREDIT</h4><p>There is one more setting to consider when slowing a clip. (This does not apply when creating fast motion.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed012.jpg"
                      alt="speed012"
                ></p>
<p>Using, again, either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” menu, select Video Quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal. This is the best choice for speeds of 50% or faster.</li>
<li>Frame Blending. This is the best choice for speeds of about 20% to 50%.</li>
<li>Optical Flow. This is the best choice for speeds slower than about 20%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frame blending puts a short dissolve between frames when running in slow motion to improve the illusion of motion. Optical Flow invents in-between frames to minimize the jerkiness of extremely slow motion.</p>
<p>Frame blending is relatively fast and easy. Optical Flow will look better in most cases, but takes a long time to render.</p>

<p>Add a speed ramp transition at the end of the Hold frame by clicking the downward-pointing arrow next to the word “Hold” in the Retime Editor.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="speed018"
                ></p>
<p>To change the actual frame being held, double-click the bar icon to the LEFT of the red Hold section and choose Source Frame (Edit). This allows you to slide the Hold frame selection left or right.</p>
<p>NOTE: Changing the source frame is a feature that I like a LOT!</p>
<h4 id="3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION-3"><a href="#3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION"></a>3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION</h4><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed007.jpg" alt="fast/slow motion"></p>
<p>We use slow-motion to show events that are too fast for the unaided eye to see. And fast motion to speed up very slow events. Both of these effects use what’s called a “constant speed change,” where the entire clip changes by the same amount - either faster or slower.</p>
<p>WE create either effect using the same tools, just different values. Here’s how.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed008.jpg"
                      alt="slow motion"
                ></p>
<p>Select the clip who’s speed you want to change. Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” Toolbar icon, select Slow (or Fast).</p>
<p>Choose one of the available speeds; in this case, 50%. (Yes, you can change this to any value you want, I’ll show you how in a minute.)</p>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed009.jpg" alt="create slow/fast motion"></p>
<p>Three things happen at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>The duration of the clip changes</li>
<li>The orange Retiming bar appears over the top of the clip</li>
<li>The speed of the clip changes</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed010.jpg"
                      alt="speed010"
                ></p>
<p>To reset the speed back to normal (100%), click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Normal (100%).</p>
<p>There are two ways to change the speed of a clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed017.jpg"
                      alt="speed017"
                ></p>
<p>The easy way is to grab the small handle at the end of the clip and drag left or right. The speed will change as you drag it.</p>
<p>Or, for more precision, click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Custom.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed011.jpg"
                      alt="speed011"
                ></p>
<p>This opens a new dialog allowing a number of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse. Plays the clip in reverse.</li>
<li>Rate. Select a specific speed change as a percentage of normal speed for a clip. Less than 100% is slow-motion. More than 100% is fast-motion.</li>
<li>Duration. Select a specific duration for a clip and FCP X will calculate how fast or slow it needs to go.</li>
<li>Ripple. When checked, adjusts the duration of a clip based upon the speed. When unchecked, the clip duration remains fixed even when speed changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get the smoothest speed changes when the percentage you choose divides evenly into 200. For example, 100, 66, 50, 40, 33, 25, 20, 10 and so on.</p>
<h4 id="4-EXTRA-CREDIT-3"><a href="#4-EXTRA-CREDIT-3" class="headerlink" title="4.  EXTRA CREDIT"></a>4.  EXTRA CREDIT</h4><p>There is one more setting to consider when slowing a clip. (This does not apply when creating fast motion.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed012.jpg"
                      alt="speed012"
                ></p>
<p>Using, again, either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” menu, select Video Quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal. This is the best choice for speeds of 50% or faster.</li>
<li>Frame Blending. This is the best choice for speeds of about 20% to 50%.</li>
<li>Optical Flow. This is the best choice for speeds slower than about 20%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frame blending puts a short dissolve between frames when running in slow motion to improve the illusion of motion. Optical Flow invents in-between frames to minimize the jerkiness of extremely slow motion.</p>
<p>Frame blending is relatively fast and easy. Optical Flow will look better in most cases, but takes a long time to render.</p>
