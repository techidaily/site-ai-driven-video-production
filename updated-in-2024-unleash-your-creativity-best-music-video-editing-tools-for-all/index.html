These days vertical videos are widely used and they also have a market on social media. But before you are creating these videos vertically, you need to be very careful about the things. Here are some tips that can make your vertical videos even better:</p>
<p><strong>Aspect ratios:</strong> The <strong>Aspect ratio for social media</strong>plays a major role in the success of the videos. This is the reason why aspect ratios are must to understand.

<p><strong>Stay closer to the subjects:</strong> When you are shooting your videos in a vertical frame then it can make easier for you to stay closer to your subjects. As people will be scrolling through the application then your video will be at the center. Sometimes, these videos are cut awkwardly. If you shoot the video properly then you can keep yourself away from such issues.</p>
<p><strong>Grab the attention:</strong> users on social media spend no time to switch to another content or other version of the particular content.

This rule means that you should not keep the subject or object directly in front of the frame. This can look ugly and will not suit every time. Instead of this, you can make the use of imaginary vertical and horizontal lines to create better and interesting composition. This will make you frame divided into thirds. Your subject can be placed on these lines or in between the lines where they are meeting. You can get the feature of using the grid as a guide in most of the cameras and phones.</p>

These days vertical videos are widely used and they also have a market on social media. But before you are creating these videos vertically, you need to be very careful about the things. Here are some tips that can make your vertical videos even better:</p>
<p><strong>Aspect ratios:</strong> The <strong>Aspect ratio for social media</strong>plays a major role in the success of the videos. This is the reason why aspect ratios are must to understand. As far as vertical videos are concerned it can be said that the aspect ratio can be anything just greater than 1:The most recommended aspect ratio for vertical video is 9:16 as it covers the whole screen and also it is more immersive.</p>
<p><strong>Stay closer to the subjects:</strong> When you are shooting your videos in a vertical frame then it can make easier for you to stay closer to your subjects. As people will be scrolling through the application then your video will be at the center. Sometimes, these videos are cut awkwardly. If you shoot the video properly then you can keep yourself away from such issues.</p>
<p><strong>Grab the attention:</strong> users on social media spend no time to switch to another content or other version of the particular content. This is why it becomes so important to catch the attention of your viewers immediately. Try to keep the first couple of moments exceptionally engaging. This will boost the attention of the audience and also make them stay on your video.</p>
<p><strong>Rule of third can benefit you:</strong> If you are wishing to follow this rule then it is important to know the reason behind this rule. This rule means that you should not keep the subject or object directly in front of the frame. This can look ugly and will not suit every time. Instead of this, you can make the use of imaginary vertical and horizontal lines to create better and interesting composition. This will make you frame divided into thirds. Your subject can be placed on these lines or in between the lines where they are meeting. You can get the feature of using the grid as a guide in most of the cameras and phones.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>

<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the simple editing version comes with essential features, which are also best for quick vlog editing. So if you’re in a hurry and need to upload videos to your channel daily, you can use the simple mode.</p>

It features the drag-n-drop functions and offers almost all the classic video editing functions including trim, rotate, split, combine as well as adding music track, filters, and themes.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes errors appear when opening the software</p>
<h4 id="4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app-1"><a href="#4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>
<h4 id="5-DaVinci-Resolve-1"><a href="#5-DaVinci-Resolve-1" class="headerlink" title="5. DaVinci Resolve"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve" >DaVinci Resolve <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free and premium version</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>
<h4 id="6-VN-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#6-VN-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="6. VN Video Editor"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vlognow.me/" >VN Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>
<p>Not meant for professional editors</p>
<h4 id="7-VideoPad-1"><a href="#7-VideoPad-1" class="headerlink" title="7.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes errors appear when opening the software</p>
<h4 id="4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app-2"><a href="#4-GoPro-Quik-Desktop-app-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>
<h4 id="5-DaVinci-Resolve-2"><a href="#5-DaVinci-Resolve-2" class="headerlink" title="5. DaVinci Resolve"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve" >DaVinci Resolve <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free and premium version</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>
<h4 id="6-VN-Video-Editor-2"><a href="#6-VN-Video-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="6. VN Video Editor"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vlognow.me/" >VN Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>
<p>Not meant for professional editors</p>
<h4 id="7-VideoPad-2"><a href="#7-VideoPad-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>
<h4 id="8-VideoProc-Vlogger-2"><a href="#8-VideoProc-Vlogger-2" class="headerlink" title="8.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>100% secure</p>
<p>Free tech – support</p>
<p>Video tutorials available</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Minor issues with clips splitting</p>

<p>Over the course of the last couple of decades, Final Cut Pro has become one of the most frequently used video editing software packages in the film industry.

A broad spectrum of video editing options grants you the creative freedom to visualize any idea, regardless of how complex that idea may be. However, if you are new to Final Cut Pro, you will   <strong>need a lot of practice in order to be able to utilize its capabilities entirely.</strong></p>

The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can <strong>only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>If you’re traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>It offers cloud storage</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Some good features are paid and expensive</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows and MacOS</p>
<p>Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>Complete video production tool with audio post-production options</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>4K video editing requires a premium version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS</p>
<p>Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.</p>
<p>So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>No watermark and easy to use</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like</strong></p>
<p>No direct download link</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.</p>
<p>In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>What we like:</strong></p>
<p>The free version includes lots of exciting features</p>
<p>Affordable upgrade</p>
<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong></p>
<p>Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Mac and Windows OS</p>
<p>VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan &amp; zoom, and motion cropping.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can also do color grading and color correction along with HSL color adjustment. In the same way, you can fix low light and overexposure and reduce noise.</p>
<p>A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the simple editing version comes with essential features, which are also best for quick vlog editing. So if you’re in a hurry and need to upload videos to your channel daily, you can use the simple mode.</p>
