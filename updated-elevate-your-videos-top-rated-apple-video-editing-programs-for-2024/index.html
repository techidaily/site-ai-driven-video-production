            <h2 id="Elevate-Your-Videos-Top-Rated-Apple-Video-Editing-Programs"><a href="#Elevate-Your-Videos-Top-Rated-Apple-Video-Editing-Programs" class="headerlink" title="Elevate Your Videos: Top-Rated Apple Video Editing Programs"></a>Elevate Your Videos: Top-Rated Apple Video Editing Programs</h2><p>Apple is widely known for its iPhone, iPad, and Macitonsh computer around the world, but do you know that it also provides some fantastic video editing software for creators? In this article, we’ve compiled a list of the best <strong>Apple</strong> <strong>video</strong> <strong>editing</strong> software on the market right now, including free, freemium, and premium solutions.</p>
<p>With these apps, you can modify videos on your smartphones or computers easily. And if you’ve invested in an iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max that can capture video in the high-resolution ProRes standard, you’ll find reliable software to make the most of your video. We’ll go over which applications are excellent for specific chores and provide statistics to help you discover the best match. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try"></a>Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try</h2><p>In today’s world, photos and videos are an integral part of everyone’s life. Mobile phones, laptops, and cameras may all be used to capture them. But, it might not be easy to organize and decorate them according to one’s unique preferences. Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.</p>
<p>In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.</p>
<h3 id="1-Photos"><a href="#1-Photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Photos"></a>1. Photos</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPadOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>The number one on our list is the Photos app. It’s among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Photos App?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.</p>
<p>Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to <strong>add text</strong>, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can <strong>rotate, crop and auto enhance</strong> videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap <strong>Revert</strong> to restore to the original version.</p>
<p>If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can <strong>adjust the focus points and the depth of the field</strong> in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo’s time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.</p>
<h3 id="2-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#2-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickTime Player"></a>2. QuickTime Player</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that’s not to say this one doesn’t have excellent features to offer.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trim, Combine,</strong> <strong>Rotate, Split MOV Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature. Further, you can combine two videos to make one excellent video for your presentation. The app also allows you to split different videos and combine them to produce more quality content.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record Screen and Voiceover</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you think your video footage can do well with a background voiceover of someone else, QuickTime Player allows you to record your audios in the background while your video plays smoothly. You can also record the desktop screen with the Player.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shrink Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe your video looks better with a small size in appearance, try shrinking it using the shrink feature in the QuickTime Player. You can lower the video quality from 1080p, 720p to whatever your phone or Mac storage deems compatible.</p>
<h3 id="3-Clips"><a href="#3-Clips" class="headerlink" title="3. Clips"></a>3. Clips</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to Use</p>
<p>You might not have heard of Clips as much as you may have heard about the others on this list. But don’t sleep on this one. Clips have slowly but surely gained the attraction of expert video editors, and you’d see almost all of them having Clips on their iPhones or Macs.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Clips?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Clips is interesting to check out when you’re an iOS fan. You can use this free video editing app to record and edit 16:9, 4:3 or square videos with various camera effects, stunning filters, animated text, music, emoji, stickers, and more, and then share it with your friends or family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family-Oriented</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips is mainly oriented towards families and children, and it isn’t even close to the capabilities of iMovie. Nonetheless, it is moving closer to be a genuine video editing program with each new version.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AR Spaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips, for instance, introduced AR Spaces, an augmented reality function for iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro owners, in April.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the most recent version in September enables you to import and edit video shot in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 and ProRes footage from the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max.</p>
<h3 id="4-iMovie"><a href="#4-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="4. iMovie"></a>4. iMovie</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPadOS&#x2F;macOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>One of the most recognizable apps in the Apple market for video editing software is the iMovie app. Almost all professional experts are reaping the benefits of using the iMovie app. The app developers have emphasized greatly equipping the professionals and the newbies who so desperately want to make their mark into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with iMovie?</strong></p>
<p>iMovie, is more like Final Cut Pro X’s younger sibling. But it’s free with your Mac, so there’s no danger in giving it a shot. It’s an excellent option for newcomers learning to use editing software, casual enthusiasts, and even YouTubers who wish to cut up their films.</p>
<ul>

Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.</p>
<p>However, if you are a beginner, we won’t recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.</p>
<p>When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it’s really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.</p>

Your budget will not always be sufficient, and you will frequently find yourselves at a fork in the road when the funds are few. So, the good news for FCPX editors is that there is a slew of free plugins, including overlays, LUTs, flares, and titles, that are very excellent (and don’t seem like your dingus friend produced them). You can watch the tutorial course if you want to learn more about these free and paid plugins in all price ranges.</p>

<p>When you’re learning from a seasoned expert, it’s easy to feel left behind as they go through tools and features you’ve never heard of. On the other hand, the Totally Exposed channel puts such concerns to rest with one-of-a-kind lessons in which we learn with Neil, a novice who has never used FCP X before.</p>
<p>Importing, basic terminologies, cutting clips, and adding music, as well as adding effects, titles, and exporting the finished material, are all covered in this video. It’s more of a trawling movie than a fast instruction at over one hour long. However, it’s ideal for novice users who want to take things a little more slowly and absorb knowledge over time.</p>
<p><strong>Why recommend this channle?</strong></p>
<p>• Extensive yet still very well-paced for beginners.</p>
<p>• Amazing teaching skills.</p>
<p>However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.</p>

<p>FCP.co is dedicated to all things video on the Mac, focusing on Final Cut Pro X video editing techniques and lessons. They’re continuously updated on the latest FCPX third-party plugins and filters (including many free effects). Unlike Apple’s FCPX user forum, this one is quite active and updated frequently.</p>

<p>On Apple’s official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software&#x2F;hardware concerns. It’s worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!</p>

<p>On Apple’s official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software&#x2F;hardware concerns. It’s worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!</p>

<p>FCPX.tv, with its motto “all things Final Cut Pro X,” is a one-stop shop for the most up-to-date advice and news on this software. An endless list of Final Cut Pro X requests (for future versions and upgrades), FCPX editing lessons, and documentation of known FCPX issues are just a few of the highlights. If you’re an FCPX power editor, this is a must-visit website.</p>

Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.</p>
<p>However, if you are a beginner, we won’t recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.</p>
<p>When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it’s really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.</p>

The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software&#x2F;hardware concerns.

Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.</p>
<p>However, if you are a beginner, we won’t recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.</p>

<p> Instagram’s announcement that the stop motion feature will become available in the Stories section created quite a buzz on the Internet, a while ago. In 2020, the feature remains relatively unknown to social media users, even though on paper it seemed promising.</p>
<p> Stop motion videos, are simply sequentially taken photos that create an illusion of movement once they are played one after the other. These <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >types of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are growing more popular on social media, as they can make Instagram stories or any other social media feed more interesting.

<p> You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.</p>
<p> Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten. Tap on the Done button that is located at the top of the screen once you completed the process of making a stop motion video and then proceed to choose stickers you would like to include in the story you created.

<p> Like all other Instagram stories, stop motion videos created with this app are only available for 24 hours if you don’t save them on your phone.

If the issue persists, you should opt for some other stop motion app you can use free of charge. ;</p>

With so many different options on the market, finding the app that provides you with all features you need to create stop motion videos can be a difficult task. That’s why we shortlisted the three best apps for iPhones and Android devices that enable you to make animated stop motion videos for Instagram.</p>
<h3 id="1-Over"><a href="#1-Over" class="headerlink" title="1. Over"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.madewithover.com/" >Over <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, offers in-app purchase</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android</p>
<p> Over allows you to do much more than just create stop motion videos you can post on Instagram since it is equipped with a versatile set of tools that can help you improve the brand awareness on social media. There are more than 700 <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to choose from and each of them enables you to adjust your photos and videos to the social network’s demands. However, the free version of the app offers only limited capabilities, and you must upgrade to the Pro version if you want to have access to all photo and video editing tools Over have to offer.</p>

<p> Creating content for social media with Mojo is a simple process that can be completed in just three easy steps. You don’t even need a Mojo account to start creating stories with this app. All you have to do is select an animated template, import videos or photos and edit it before tapping on the share button. There are more than a hundred animated templates to choose from, so after you pick one, you just have to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add text overlays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but you must purchase Mojo Pro if you want to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >change aspect ratios <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, duplicate stories or have access to all text styles and templates.</p>

                ></p>
<p> The fact that more than a million video content creators and brands are using Life Lapse to make stop motion videos says a lot about the app’s capabilities. Unlike Over and Mojo, Life Lapse lets you set the exposure and focus locks, switch on a grid or use the ghosted image overlay. Besides capturing photos and videos, the app also allows you to import photos you want to include in the stop motion animation. Furthermore, even the free version of Life Lapse offers a variety of video editing tools that allow you to crop images or adjust saturation, brightness or white balance values in each frame.</p>

As soon as the camera loads you’ll be asked to choose if you would like to create a photo or a video project. Tap on the photo option and start taking photos of the objects or people you want to include in your stop motion video.</p>
<p> The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds. Furthermore, changing a video’s aspect ratio to 9:16 is recommended, as it will enable you to know exactly how your stop motion video is going to look like after you upload it to Instagram.</p>

Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.</p>
<h3 id="1-Develop-a-concept"><a href="#1-Develop-a-concept" class="headerlink" title="1. Develop a concept"></a>1. Develop a concept</h3><p> What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.</p>
<h3 id="2-Shoot-in-studio-conditions"><a href="#2-Shoot-in-studio-conditions" class="headerlink" title="2. Shoot in studio conditions"></a>2. Shoot in studio conditions</h3><p> Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos. Which app are you using to create stop motion videos? Leave a comment and let us know.</p>

<p> Instagram’s announcement that the stop motion feature will become available in the Stories section created quite a buzz on the Internet, a while ago. In 2020, the feature remains relatively unknown to social media users, even though on paper it seemed promising.</p>
<p> Stop motion videos, are simply sequentially taken photos that create an illusion of movement once they are played one after the other. These <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >types of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are growing more popular on social media, as they can make Instagram stories or any other social media feed more interesting. You are at the right place if you would like to join video content creators who already <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >produce stop motion videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because in this article we are going to show you how to make a stop motion video on Instagram.</p>

After you launch the app, you should tap on the <strong>Camera</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the screen. The new window will open where you can choose the type of Instagram story you want to create, so you can pick to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >go live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, record a video normally or use the app’s Boomerang feature.</p>
<p> You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.</p>
<p> Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten. Tap on the Done button that is located at the top of the screen once you completed the process of making a stop motion video and then proceed to choose stickers you would like to include in the story you created. Press the Send To button and decide if you want to share the stop motion video to your Instagram or Facebook story or with some of your Instagram followers. ;</p>

<p> Instagram’s announcement that the stop motion feature will become available in the Stories section created quite a buzz on the Internet, a while ago. In 2020, the feature remains relatively unknown to social media users, even though on paper it seemed promising.</p>
<p> Stop motion videos, are simply sequentially taken photos that create an illusion of movement once they are played one after the other. These <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >types of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are growing more popular on social media, as they can make Instagram stories or any other social media feed more interesting. You are at the right place if you would like to join video content creators who already <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >produce stop motion videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because in this article we are going to show you how to make a stop motion video on Instagram.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Video-on-Instagram-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Video-on-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Make a Stop Motion Video on Instagram?"></a>Part 1: How to Make a Stop Motion Video on Instagram?</h2><p> The technical side of making a stop motion video on Instagram is rather simple since you can enable this feature in just a few taps. After you launch the app, you should tap on the <strong>Camera</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the screen. The new window will open where you can choose the type of Instagram story you want to create, so you can pick to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >go live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, record a video normally or use the app’s Boomerang feature.</p>
<p> You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.</p>
<p> Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten. Tap on the Done button that is located at the top of the screen once you completed the process of making a stop motion video and then proceed to choose stickers you would like to include in the story you created. Press the Send To button and decide if you want to share the stop motion video to your Instagram or Facebook story or with some of your Instagram followers. ;</p>

<h3 id="Cons-of-Making-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Instagram-3"><a href="#Cons-of-Making-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="Cons of Making Stop Motion Videos with Instagram"></a>Cons of Making Stop Motion Videos with Instagram</h3><p> Even though Instagram’s new stop motion feature offers an easy way to make your stories more interesting, it still has a few downsides. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Adding sound or music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to stop motion videos you create with Instagram isn’t possible at the moment, and you can’t do much more other than downloading the video to your device.</p>
<p> Like all other Instagram stories, stop motion videos created with this app are only available for 24 hours if you don’t save them on your phone. Moreover, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >downloading the stories you create with Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’s stop motion tool will enable you to edit them with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing apps for iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Android devices and post them to any social media platform you choose.</p>
<p> In addition, the maximum number of frames a stop motion video created with Instagram can have is limited to just ten.</p>

If the issue persists, you should opt for some other stop motion app you can use free of charge. ;</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-3-Best-Stop-Motion-Apps-you-can-Use-to-Create-Animated-Videos-for-Instagram-3"><a href="#Part-2-3-Best-Stop-Motion-Apps-you-can-Use-to-Create-Animated-Videos-for-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 3 Best Stop Motion Apps you can Use to Create Animated Videos for Instagram"></a>Part 2: 3 Best Stop Motion Apps you can Use to Create Animated Videos for Instagram</h2><p> You shouldn’t worry if the stop motion feature isn’t available on the version of Instagram you’re using, because there are so many apps that are equipped with this tool. With so many different options on the market, finding the app that provides you with all features you need to create stop motion videos can be a difficult task. That’s why we shortlisted the three best apps for iPhones and Android devices that enable you to make animated stop motion videos for Instagram.</p>
<h3 id="1-Over-3"><a href="#1-Over-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Over"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.madewithover.com/" >Over <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, offers in-app purchase</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android</p>
<p> Over allows you to do much more than just create stop motion videos you can post on Instagram since it is equipped with a versatile set of tools that can help you improve the brand awareness on social media. There are more than 700 <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >templates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to choose from and each of them enables you to adjust your photos and videos to the social network’s demands. However, the free version of the app offers only limited capabilities, and you must upgrade to the Pro version if you want to have access to all photo and video editing tools Over have to offer.</p>
<h3 id="2-Mojo-3"><a href="#2-Mojo-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Mojo"></a>2. Mojo</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, offers in-app purchases</p>

<p> Creating content for social media with Mojo is a simple process that can be completed in just three easy steps. You don’t even need a Mojo account to start creating stories with this app. All you have to do is select an animated template, import videos or photos and edit it before tapping on the share button. There are more than a hundred animated templates to choose from, so after you pick one, you just have to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add text overlays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but you must purchase Mojo Pro if you want to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >change aspect ratios <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, duplicate stories or have access to all text styles and templates.</p>
<h3 id="3-Life-Lapse-3"><a href="#3-Life-Lapse-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

                ></p>
<p> The fact that more than a million video content creators and brands are using Life Lapse to make stop motion videos says a lot about the app’s capabilities. Unlike Over and Mojo, Life Lapse lets you set the exposure and focus locks, switch on a grid or use the ghosted image overlay. Besides capturing photos and videos, the app also allows you to import photos you want to include in the stop motion animation. Furthermore, even the free version of Life Lapse offers a variety of video editing tools that allow you to crop images or adjust saturation, brightness or white balance values in each frame.</p>

As soon as the camera loads you’ll be asked to choose if you would like to create a photo or a video project. Tap on the photo option and start taking photos of the objects or people you want to include in your stop motion video.</p>
<p> The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds. Furthermore, changing a video’s aspect ratio to 9:16 is recommended, as it will enable you to know exactly how your stop motion video is going to look like after you upload it to Instagram.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Tips-for-Creating-Stop-Motion-Videos-for-Instagram-3"><a href="#Part-4-Tips-for-Creating-Stop-Motion-Videos-for-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram"></a>Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram</h2><p> The process of making a stop motion animation is not technically complicated since you just need to place your phone on a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >tripod <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and take a photo each time you move an object in the shot. Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.</p>
<h3 id="1-Develop-a-concept-3"><a href="#1-Develop-a-concept-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Develop a concept"></a>1. Develop a concept</h3><p> What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.</p>
<h3 id="2-Shoot-in-studio-conditions-3"><a href="#2-Shoot-in-studio-conditions-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Shoot in studio conditions"></a>2. Shoot in studio conditions</h3><p> Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos. Which app are you using to create stop motion videos? Leave a comment and let us know.</p>
