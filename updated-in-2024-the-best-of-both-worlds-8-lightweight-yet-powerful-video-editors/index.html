There is no need for a heavyweight video editor that is generally used by professionals. Besides, an industry-grade video editor demands high-end computer as they put pressure on your system resources for video processing and rendering.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you do not have a high-end computer for video editing, a lightweight video editor is perfect for you. There are so many lightweight video editing software applications available to choose from for video editing. We have picked the best light video editing software for smooth and satisfying video editing work.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-The-Features-for-Light-Video-Editor"><a href="#Part-1-The-Features-for-Light-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Features for Light Video Editor"></a>Part 1. The Features for Light Video Editor</h2><p>Here are the main features of a good lightweight video editor that you should be aware of.</p>
<p>Small File Size – A light video editor comes in a small size file, and you will understand the file size when you download it on your computer. Ideally, a light video editor should not be above a couple of hundred MBs in size.</p>
<p>Wide OS Compatibility – A good light video editor should not only be compatible with the latest version of computer operating system but also with older versions. This is because older operating systems fail to run a heavyweight video editor smoothly.</p>
<p>Low System Requirements – Every video editor lists out their system requirements starting from processor version to RAM capacity and free disk space. A light video editor should have low system requirements such as 4GB RAM, 5GB free disk space, Intel i3 or likewise.</p>
<p>Low CPU Usage – How much CPU resource a video editor uses determines whether the video editor is truly lightweight. You can monitor how much CPU resource an application is using from Task Manager. For a light video editor, it should never be more than 33% of the total CPU usage at any given time.</p>
<p>Faster Processing – A lightweight video editor is generally faster in processing and rendering videos. They use different techniques such as compression, background processing and proxy workflow to boost processing speed without affecting system performance.</p>

<p>The popularity of video content on social media networks has been soaring in the last couple of years, and it is only reasonable to expect this trend to continue. Tutorials, promotional videos and various other types of videos for social media help companies run successful advertising campaigns and increase their profits. You don’t have to be a seasoned video editing professional in order to create videos for social networks, in fact, you can make viral videos even with entry-level video editing software, like iMovie or Avidemux. That’s the reason why in this article we are going to introduce you to 10+ best video editing apps you can use online, on Mac and PC computers or Smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024"></a>Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024</h2><p>Anyone who has access to a computer that runs on a macOS or Windows OS can edit videos for free because both of these operating systems have built-in video editing software. Let’s take a look at the free video editing options Mac and PC users have at their disposal in 2024.</p>
<h4 id="1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS"><a href="#1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS</h4><p>Learning how to use iMovie to create videos for social media won’t take too much of your time, as the app’s intuitive interface makes performing all basic video editing actions look easy. iMovie lets you edit footage recorded in resolutions up to 4K and it features 10 high fidelity filters that enhance the colors in your videos. The app also lets you create PIP and split screen videos, alter the playback speed of a video clip or create engaging opening titles or end credits. The royalty-free music, sound effects or the voiceover recording feature can all help you create a perfect soundtrack for each video you edit in iMovie.</p>

The app’s Edit&amp;Create menu offers Draw, Add slo-mo or Trim tools that allow you to draw over the source footage and remove unwanted pieces of video clips from the timeline. The Photos App is equipped with a number of 3D effects and a rich collection of filters that can assist you in creating a distinctive visual style for each new video you edit with it. However, the app’s exporting options are far from impressive, since you can’t export your projects to social media directly from the Photos App.</p>

Windows Movie Maker grants you access to a huge collection of transitions and visual effects and it makes the process of creating titles effortless. Certain options like video stabilization are only available on the version of the video editing software that is compatible with Windows 8, and the exact list of the tools provided by Windows Movie Maker varies on different versions of the Windows OS.</p>
<h4 id="4-Avidemux-–Best-Free-Open-Source-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-in-2020"><a href="#4-Avidemux-–Best-Free-Open-Source-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-in-2020" class="headerlink" title="4.

This open source video editor is compatible with Linux, macOS and Windows OS, which means that you can edit videos with it regardless of the computer you have. Avidemux supports nearly all video file formats, and it is a perfect choice for all video content creators who frequently shoot their videos on different cameras.

<p>The popularity of video content on social media networks has been soaring in the last couple of years, and it is only reasonable to expect this trend to continue. Tutorials, promotional videos and various other types of videos for social media help companies run successful advertising campaigns and increase their profits. You don’t have to be a seasoned video editing professional in order to create videos for social networks, in fact, you can make viral videos even with entry-level video editing software, like iMovie or Avidemux. That’s the reason why in this article we are going to introduce you to 10+ best video editing apps you can use online, on Mac and PC computers or Smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024-1"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024"></a>Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024</h2><p>Anyone who has access to a computer that runs on a macOS or Windows OS can edit videos for free because both of these operating systems have built-in video editing software. Let’s take a look at the free video editing options Mac and PC users have at their disposal in 2024.</p>
<h4 id="1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS-1"><a href="#1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS-1" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS</h4><p>Learning how to use iMovie to create videos for social media won’t take too much of your time, as the app’s intuitive interface makes performing all basic video editing actions look easy. iMovie lets you edit footage recorded in resolutions up to 4K and it features 10 high fidelity filters that enhance the colors in your videos. The app also lets you create PIP and split screen videos, alter the playback speed of a video clip or create engaging opening titles or end credits. The royalty-free music, sound effects or the voiceover recording feature can all help you create a perfect soundtrack for each video you edit in iMovie.</p>
<h4 id="2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10-1"><a href="#2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

The app’s Edit&amp;Create menu offers Draw, Add slo-mo or Trim tools that allow you to draw over the source footage and remove unwanted pieces of video clips from the timeline. The Photos App is equipped with a number of 3D effects and a rich collection of filters that can assist you in creating a distinctive visual style for each new video you edit with it. However, the app’s exporting options are far from impressive, since you can’t export your projects to social media directly from the Photos App.</p>

Windows Movie Maker grants you access to a huge collection of transitions and visual effects and it makes the process of creating titles effortless. Certain options like video stabilization are only available on the version of the video editing software that is compatible with Windows 8, and the exact list of the tools provided by Windows Movie Maker varies on different versions of the Windows OS.</p>

This open source video editor is compatible with Linux, macOS and Windows OS, which means that you can edit videos with it regardless of the computer you have. Avidemux supports nearly all video file formats, and it is a perfect choice for all video content creators who frequently shoot their videos on different cameras. Nonetheless, the number of video editing tools Avidemux offers is far from impressive which limits your options during the video editing process.</p>

Once you know what you want to accomplish you should <strong>acquire as much information as you possibly can about a video editing software</strong> in order to find out if the video editor you’re considering can help you accomplish your goal. The <strong>price</strong> is yet another factor you should consider since you don’t have to spend a lot of money on video editing software that takes years to master if you just want to create a promotional video for your company.</p>
<p>Besides the features, a video editing application offers, you should also <strong>try to find out how user-friendly its interface is</strong> and how <strong>comfortable or efficient</strong> you are while working on a project in a video editing software. <strong>Installing a trial version</strong> of a video editor might help you decide if that editor is the right choice for you. If you have absolutely no previous video editing experience, then it is best to start with a simple video editing app like iMovie or the Photos App and then switch to a more advanced video editor once you develop your video editing skills.</p>

Once you know what you want to accomplish you should <strong>acquire as much information as you possibly can about a video editing software</strong> in order to find out if the video editor you’re considering can help you accomplish your goal. The <strong>price</strong> is yet another factor you should consider since you don’t have to spend a lot of money on video editing software that takes years to master if you just want to create a promotional video for your company.</p>
<p>Besides the features, a video editing application offers, you should also <strong>try to find out how user-friendly its interface is</strong> and how <strong>comfortable or efficient</strong> you are while working on a project in a video editing software. <strong>Installing a trial version</strong> of a video editor might help you decide if that editor is the right choice for you. If you have absolutely no previous video editing experience, then it is best to start with a simple video editing app like iMovie or the Photos App and then switch to a more advanced video editor once you develop your video editing skills.</p>
