<p>Cartooning a photo is a simple and yet effective way of enhancing a picture and making it more visually appealing. Besides adding an artistic touch to portraits you take, cartooning a photo can also be a great way to have fun with your friends because the results of picture cartooning can be as entertaining as visually striking.</p>
<p>Besides portraiture, this visual effect can be applied to virtually any other genre of photography, although the contents of the shoot usually determine how well the effect is going to work. What’s more, you don’t need a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to cartoon a photo, since there are so many websites that let you apply this effect to your photos for free.</p>
<p>That’s why we selected some of the best websites for converting a photo into a cartoon.</p>

In fact, online cartoon photo makers are easy to use and they don’t require you to have a lot of photo editing experience.</p>
<p>We’ve selected some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best online photo editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and photo converters that enable you to cartoon your photos in just a few clicks.</p>

Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h4 id="2-BeFunky-3"><a href="#2-BeFunky-3" class="headerlink" title="2. BeFunky"></a>2. BeFunky</h4><p>Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from <strong>five different cartoonization effects</strong> that are all equally impressive.</p>
<p>All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.</p>
<p>Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/" >https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.</p>
<h4 id="3-Lunapic-3"><a href="#3-Lunapic-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h4><p>This is yet another online photo editing platform that gives you access to a broad range of photo editing options for free. Even though a bit outdated, the Lunapic’s interface resembles Photoshop’s interface, so you won’t need much time to get used to it if you ever used Adobe’s iconic photo editing software.</p>
<p>Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you can’t adjust the effect’s settings in case you don’t like the results.</p>

<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources.

<p>Being criticized for years due to its simplified technology and features, FCPX or Final Cut Pro is the next possible option other than iMovie that comes to rescue Mac users’. With surplus features like clean user-interface, video effects, transitions, and a lot more, Apple has concerted efforts, like other NLEs. Although some users find difficulty identifying specific Final Cut Pro X tools, some incredibly potent but frequently overlooked tools are still under the lid.</p>
<p>Yes, certain top-notch features like optical flow, jump cut at markers, markers as subtitles, adjustment layers, and still a lot more video editing abilities are hidden where today, we will expose a technique on how to <strong>jump-cut like a pro</strong> with FCPX. Make sure you stick till the last so that you can get to know other options related to <strong>Final Cut Pro</strong> <strong>jump cuts</strong> as well.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Create-Jump-Cuts-with-Markers-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X-2"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Create-Jump-Cuts-with-Markers-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Create Jump Cuts with Markers in Final Cut Pro X?"></a>Part 1: How to Create Jump Cuts with Markers in Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>Jump cuts are a sort of split edit performed on your video where you can jump over your video clips to keep the desire and delete the unwanted. Although it might seem similar to cut operation, jump cuts are preferable by YouTubers and vloggers. Here is a guide to teach <strong>how to do jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro</strong> with markers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a fresh project and import media files</strong></p>
<p>Launch the Final Cut Pro X app, and once opened, create a new project by executing “File &gt; New &gt; Project”. Type the name of your project or video, and press “<strong>OK</strong>“.</p>
<p>Now, you can start to import the video file to add the jump cuts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add markers</strong></p>
<p>Bring the video into the timeline, and play the video. To add markers before creating jump cuts on the timeline, bring the pointer to the clip where you need to divide it into segments and press “<strong>M</strong>“.</p>
<p>A blue marker will be on the video timeline. Similarly, you can place markers on places wherever required.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Apply jump cuts</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, to apply quick jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro, tap the speed icon from the timeline where you will get various options from which you need to click the “<strong>Jump Cuts at Markers</strong>” option.</p>
<p>You can specify the frame range based on which the jump cuts will get executed in the video.</p>
<p>Thus, this is <strong>how to do jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro</strong> by speeding up the clips based on frames hence helping the action happen in just a fraction of seconds.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-a-Jump-Cut-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-a-Jump-Cut-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix a Jump Cut in Final Cut Pro X?"></a>Part 2: How to Fix a Jump Cut in Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>If you do jump cuts with markers in FCPX, you do not need to fix it, but if you opt for the other way of cut and delete, you must set them for a smoother process. Let’s take a look at <strong>how to fix a jump cut</strong> by transition addition.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. After importing your media files, perform jump cuts by following the previous section.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. To fix jump cuts, place the pointer on the clip, and tap the transition icon from the timeline menu with various options. Primarily “<strong>Flow</strong>“ transition option is used in FCPX.</p>
<p>Tap any option, and Final Cut Pro X will automatically apply it to the clip.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Hide-Jump-Cuts-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Hide-Jump-Cuts-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Hide Jump Cuts in Final Cut Pro X?"></a>Part 3: How to Hide Jump Cuts in Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>Want to hide jump cuts in Final Cut Pro X? Then, here is the session to know <strong>how to hide jump cuts</strong> in FCPX with two options: resizing the video clip and synchronizing clips.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Resizing the clip</strong></p>
<p>To do this method, select a clip. It could be the first one or the latter. Now, click on the “Resize” icon.</p>
<p>You can resize the clip using the circle resize option near the video preview or the “Scale” option on the right corner.</p>
<p>Doing so will add effects to the video clip hiding the jump cuts added.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Synchronizing clips</strong></p>
<p>Another way to hide jump cuts in Final Cut Pro X is to synchronize the clip with the other relevant clip.</p>
<p>You can add another video to the timeline and place it where you created the jump cut.</p>
<p>When you prefer this method, you have to ensure that the synchronized video’s audio is on mute to avoid disturbing the actual one.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-6"><a href="#Conclusion-6" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After going through this blog, we know and hope you have now found how well Final Cut Pro X can help you create a <strong>jump cut like a pro</strong>. Yes, guys, are you in awe to find that your FCPX can do wonders? While many more functionalities are still under the carpet, I believe you would find out today’s article on <strong>how to do jump cuts in Final Cut Pro</strong> quite helpful.
