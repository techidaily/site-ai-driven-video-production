Why is the animation used in education?</h3><p>The Institute of Progressive Education estimates several reasons why animation helps children learn better. At an early age, the bright color and bold shapes of cartoons help us develop recognition, understand words, and even tell time.</p>

<p>By showing cell mitosis in a cartoon, the teachers can communicate actions that they would never get to see.</p>

<p>Today, we all use cameras and cell phones to capture many important events in our lives. Sometimes the recorded videos are shaky due to various factors such as a sudden hand movement, a lack of stabilization in our recording equipment, and so on.</p>
<p>Users can utilize video stabilizer applications to solve this issue. Using these applications, users may quickly smooth out shaky areas of a video on their Android smartphones. However, finding an excellent <strong>Android Video Stabilizer</strong> is still a hard task due to the number of applications present in the market. But don’t worry, a few of the best video stabilizers are reviewed in this article. Let’s get going!</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?</a></p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-OIS-and-EIS"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-OIS-and-EIS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?</h2><p>The majority of individuals favor OIS over EIS. A hardware approach is always preferable to a software platform since EIS is essentially a repair solution that causes picture resolution deterioration by cutting it and estimating what this would seem like if it were steady. OIS also performs better in low-light conditions. The best video stabilizer app for android is the one that incorporates both approaches.</p>
<p>Moreover, OIS and EIS both hold a significant reputation for video stabilization. And not much, but some people prefer Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) to stabilize their video as it converts the optical signal to a digital one. You will get a better understanding of both the stabilization technologies after reading what’s written below:</p>
<p><strong>Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)</strong></p>
<p>Electronic image stabilization operates on a fundamentally different premise, with the problem being tackled at the coding layer after the visible light has been transformed to a digital signal.</p>
<p><strong>Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)</strong></p>
<p>The picture is stabilized with this approach by altering the optical path of the detector. Because this is real-time correction, no image change or degradation occurs. The lens component is rotated such that it is parallel to the picture plane.</p>

<p>Today, we all use cameras and cell phones to capture many important events in our lives. Sometimes the recorded videos are shaky due to various factors such as a sudden hand movement, a lack of stabilization in our recording equipment, and so on.</p>
<p>Users can utilize video stabilizer applications to solve this issue. Using these applications, users may quickly smooth out shaky areas of a video on their Android smartphones. However, finding an excellent <strong>Android Video Stabilizer</strong> is still a hard task due to the number of applications present in the market. But don’t worry, a few of the best video stabilizers are reviewed in this article. Let’s get going!</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-1"><a href="#In-this-article-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?</a></p>

A hardware approach is always preferable to a software platform since EIS is essentially a repair solution that causes picture resolution deterioration by cutting it and estimating what this would seem like if it were steady. OIS also performs better in low-light conditions. The best video stabilizer app for android is the one that incorporates both approaches.</p>
<p>Moreover, OIS and EIS both hold a significant reputation for video stabilization. And not much, but some people prefer Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) to stabilize their video as it converts the optical signal to a digital one. You will get a better understanding of both the stabilization technologies after reading what’s written below:</p>
<p><strong>Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)</strong></p>
<p>Electronic image stabilization operates on a fundamentally different premise, with the problem being tackled at the coding layer after the visible light has been transformed to a digital signal.</p>
<p><strong>Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)</strong></p>
<p>The picture is stabilized with this approach by altering the optical path of the detector. Because this is real-time correction, no image change or degradation occurs. The lens component is rotated such that it is parallel to the picture plane.</p>

<p>Today, we all use cameras and cell phones to capture many important events in our lives. Sometimes the recorded videos are shaky due to various factors such as a sudden hand movement, a lack of stabilization in our recording equipment, and so on.</p>
<p>Users can utilize video stabilizer applications to solve this issue. Using these applications, users may quickly smooth out shaky areas of a video on their Android smartphones. However, finding an excellent <strong>Android Video Stabilizer</strong> is still a hard task due to the number of applications present in the market. But don’t worry, a few of the best video stabilizers are reviewed in this article. Let’s get going!</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?</a></p>
<p>02 <a href="#part2">Best Free Video Stabilizer Apps for Android</a></p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-OIS-and-EIS-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-OIS-and-EIS-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?</h2><p>The majority of individuals favor OIS over EIS. A hardware approach is always preferable to a software platform since EIS is essentially a repair solution that causes picture resolution deterioration by cutting it and estimating what this would seem like if it were steady. OIS also performs better in low-light conditions. The best video stabilizer app for android is the one that incorporates both approaches.</p>
<p>Moreover, OIS and EIS both hold a significant reputation for video stabilization. And not much, but some people prefer Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) to stabilize their video as it converts the optical signal to a digital one. You will get a better understanding of both the stabilization technologies after reading what’s written below:</p>
<p><strong>Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)</strong></p>
<p>Electronic image stabilization operates on a fundamentally different premise, with the problem being tackled at the coding layer after the visible light has been transformed to a digital signal.</p>
<p><strong>Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)</strong></p>
<p>The picture is stabilized with this approach by altering the optical path of the detector. Because this is real-time correction, no image change or degradation occurs. The lens component is rotated such that it is parallel to the picture plane.</p>
