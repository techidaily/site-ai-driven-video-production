<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>

<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>

                ></p>
<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>
<h2 id="4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity"><a href="#4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity" class="headerlink" title="4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity"></a>4.

You’ll never have another scheduling conflict again!</p>
<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>
<h2 id="5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface"><a href="#5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface" class="headerlink" title="5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface"></a>5.

<p> The basic Comcast remote is a multi-function remote and capable of controlling all functions, but it does not have the ability to connect to a portable device like a tablet or a smartphone to have connectivity that way like a TiVo can through an app. The remote has to be line of sight in order to work.</p>

<p> Many reviewers liked the interface on the TiVo better than the grid used on the Comcast service. The TiVo programming guide allows you to delete channels you don’t watch so you’re only looking at the channels you like.

<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs.

It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-2"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-2" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-2"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-2" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>

                ></p>
<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-2"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-2" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="iphone app"
                ></p>
<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>
<h2 id="4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-2"><a href="#4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-2" class="headerlink" title="4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity"></a>4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity</h2><p> The new TiVo, the Roamio, has as many as six tuners that can record at the same time with up to 150 hours of high definition programming. You’ll never have another scheduling conflict again!</p>
<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>
<h2 id="5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface-2"><a href="#5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface-2" class="headerlink" title="5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface"></a>5.

<p> The basic Comcast remote is a multi-function remote and capable of controlling all functions, but it does not have the ability to connect to a portable device like a tablet or a smartphone to have connectivity that way like a TiVo can through an app. The remote has to be line of sight in order to work.</p>

<p> The TiVo device menu is in standard definition, so for those who have a high definition set up, you may find this a bit distraction or fuzzy. It does come with apps for extending what the box can do, including games for kids.</p>
<p> Many reviewers liked the interface on the TiVo better than the grid used on the Comcast service. The TiVo programming guide allows you to delete channels you don’t watch so you’re only looking at the channels you like. Comcast’s guide covers every channel they offer, even ones that are not available on your tier of service.</p>

For cost in the long run, it’s almost a draw. For ease of connection to a TV, the Comcast box comes out on top. No matter which one you pick, you’ll never run out of great programs to watch.</p>

<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>

<p>Maximizing the conversion rates is the ultimate goal of every web marketing professional. The statistics clearly indicate that video content boosts conversion rates, more than any other type of online content, which is the reason why a growing number of marketers choose to incorporate video into their social media marketing strategies. Whiteboard animations have been around since the early days of animation, but their spike in popularity coincides with the rise of digital marketing in the mid-2000s. A little over a decade later, whiteboard animations are used for a wide array of purposes that range from explainer to educational videos. We’ve combed the Internet to find the best whiteboard animation makers in 2020, so let’s dive in and see what these software products and web-based platforms have to offer.</p>

The platform’s video editor lets you choose the gender of the hand that is drawing the animation or its skin color.

<p>Formerly known as GoAnimate, Vyond has been one of the best cloud-based video animation platforms for more than a decade. Its Whiteboard Animation theme offers a huge selection of props, character actions and other animated elements that can be useful for videos that cover a broad spectrum of topics. Simply select an element you want to add to your video, fine-tune its size on the screen and it will be drawn automatically. Vyond also enables you to import assets you’ve created which grants you more creative freedom, as you don’t necessarily have to rely solely on the built-in whiteboard animation elements this platform offers. The only downside is that you can’t record voiceovers directly from Vyond, and you either have to use an online voice recording service or utilize a desktop-based software product that enables you to record the narration for your upcoming animated video.</p>

Simply select an element you want to add to your video, fine-tune its size on the screen and it will be drawn automatically. Vyond also enables you to import assets you’ve created which grants you more creative freedom, as you don’t necessarily have to rely solely on the built-in whiteboard animation elements this platform offers. The only downside is that you can’t record voiceovers directly from Vyond, and you either have to use an online voice recording service or utilize a desktop-based software product that enables you to record the narration for your upcoming animated video.</p>

Doodly solves both of these issues by enabling you to simply drag and drop animated elements to the timeline and produce visually attractive hand-drawn animations at a reasonable price. The software features an extensive collection of male and female hands whose skin color you can adjust with a single click. There are hundreds of pre-made sketches available, and you just have to add the one you like to the canvas and Doodly will automatically animate the drawing for you. You can also choose if you want to use a whiteboard, blackboard or glassboard surface as a background for your animation. The Doodly Smart Draw technology lets you import and animate any hand drawing so you don’t have to rely on the software’s built-in library of doodles. The best part is that you can export all animations you create with Doodly in Full HD resolution.</p>

<p>Formerly known as GoAnimate, Vyond has been one of the best cloud-based video animation platforms for more than a decade. Its Whiteboard Animation theme offers a huge selection of props, character actions and other animated elements that can be useful for videos that cover a broad spectrum of topics. Simply select an element you want to add to your video, fine-tune its size on the screen and it will be drawn automatically. Vyond also enables you to import assets you’ve created which grants you more creative freedom, as you don’t necessarily have to rely solely on the built-in whiteboard animation elements this platform offers. The only downside is that you can’t record voiceovers directly from Vyond, and you either have to use an online voice recording service or utilize a desktop-based software product that enables you to record the narration for your upcoming animated video.</p>

<h3 id="1-OpenShot"><a href="#1-OpenShot" class="headerlink" title="1. OpenShot"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openshot.org/" >OpenShot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We are confident that you will not find a more user-friendly video editor than this one. OpenShot is most likely the best choice when you’re new to video production. It is simple to use, but it also has several interesting features.</p>
<p>This editor comes with a plethora of titles and transitions and compatibility for the majority of video and picture formats. You also receive an excellent export option that allows you to save files in various formats. As already mentioned, the application is designed to meet the needs of beginning learners; yet, advanced users will not be dissatisfied because it supports high-quality video formats such as 4K.</p>
<p>OpenShot has several useful audio editing capabilities, including seeing waveforms on the timeline and even displaying the waveform as part of the film. It also allows you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >separate the sound from the video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and tune each sound channel separately.</p>
<h3 id="2-OBS-Studio"><a href="#2-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="2. OBS Studio"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>OBS Studio is a free, open-source tool that can be downloaded and installed on Ubuntu and other operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Because it includes a fantastic <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen capturer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, OBS Studio is becoming famous for making videos of Ubuntu or other computer programs. OBS Studio is a basic video editor that lets us blend photos, movies, and music easily.</p>
<p>OBS Studio can create movies in the following formats: Flv, Mkv, mp4, mov, ts, and m3u8. Although the formats are not very open, they are compatible with internet video publishing sites. This editor allows us to modify video rather than merely broadcast it, albeit the editing functionality is not as robust as Kdenlive or Openshot.</p>
<p>OBS Studio also links with video streaming sites to create live videos, unlike other video editing software. This has made it a highly popular software among YouTubers and one that we can download on any Ubuntu version.</p>
<h3 id="3-PiTiVi"><a href="#3-PiTiVi" class="headerlink" title="3. PiTiVi"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pitivi.org/" >PiTiVi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like many others, this one lets you perform basic video editing activities such as trimming, cutting, snapping, splitting, and mixing. The program also supports several additional languages for those who aren’t fluent in English. You should probably read the manual before using it since it contains a lot of valuable information on using this application.</p>
<p>In a word, the application provides a touch-capable, hardware-accelerated user experience. Limitless video&#x2F;audio track layers, full undo&#x2F;redo history, trimming, cutting, sound editing of several concurrent audio layers upon layer, volume keyframe curves, keyframe audio enhancements, and more are all supported.</p>
<p>Pitivi creates thumbnails and waveforms in the background to provide you with the best performance without interfering with your workflow. Pitivi may be found in most Ubuntu software repositories. If you want, you may also download pre-assembled kits.</p>

Kdenlive"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://kdenlive.org/en/" >Kdenlive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Kdenlive is, without a doubt, one of the best video editing applications for Ubuntu available right now! What sets it apart from other video editors is that it is completely free and includes several useful features. The MLT Framework, which is based on many other open-source projects, handles most of the video editing in Kdenlive, built on Qt and the KDE Frameworks libraries.</p>
<p>Adjustable layout compatibility, a clip list, a multitrack chronology, automatic backup, keyframe special effects, and transitioning are all included in this video editing program. Do you have a special file format or camcorder? Not an issue — Kdenlive works with practically anything.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Kdenlive runs on Mac OSX and FreeBSD. Proxy editing is another useful function. This handy function can produce low-quality duplicates of your source clips for quick editing and render them in full resolution.</p>
<h3 id="5-Shotcut"><a href="#5-Shotcut" class="headerlink" title="5. Shotcut"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor is Shotcut. Unlike Kdenlive, beginner video editors would obtain a comprehensive understanding of Shotcut because of its user-friendly interface. It has indigenous timeline editing, video transitions and filters, and a multitrack timeline, among other things.</p>
<p>Keyframes for digital filters and 3-point editing are supported. Shotcut is useful if you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove the audio from a video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> rapidly. Additionally, it allows you to edit audio and 4K films. Furthermore, it allows for external monitoring.</p>
<p>JACK transport sync, audio blending throughout all channels, stereo, mono, and 5.1 surround sound capabilities are supported on the audio front. Shotcut is considered ideal for beginners, and if you are one, we would highly suggest getting this one for your Ubuntu.</p>
<h3 id="6-Lightworks"><a href="#6-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="6. Lightworks"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Because the functions go beyond the world of inexperienced editors, this video editor for Ubuntu computers is suited for specialists in video editing. The award-winning non-linear editing (NLE) program can handle 4K, Blu-Ray, and even SD and HD footage. You’ll also discover Low-Res <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Proxy workflows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for 4K and drag-and-drop support alongside those capabilities.</p>

<p>It features voice-over and just added Mackie MIDI compatibility for Ubuntu users. Lightworks supports the most analog and digital connectors, namely 12G, 3G-SDI, Optical audio, HDMI 2, and AES&#x2F;EBU connectors. The creators have also included <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional-level video editing tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and audio filters and enhancements.</p>

<p>In reality, when it comes to editing capabilities, Hitfilm Express is extremely similar to Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p>The major disadvantage of this program is that it consumes a lot of system resources, which means it won’t run on many lightweight laptops. You’ll have to pay extra for things like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >360-degree <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> text, extra color grading facilities, and other aesthetic enhancements, among other things. Hitfilm Express is a video editor that is so strong and simple to use that it’s difficult to believe it’s free. It’s a great option for any video creator on a shoestring budget.</p>

<h3 id="9-Cinelerra"><a href="#9-Cinelerra" class="headerlink" title="9. Cinelerra"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://cinelerra.org/" >Cinelerra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Cinelerra is a video editor for GNU&#x2F;Ubuntu, first released in 1998. It was the first non-linear video editor for GNU&#x2F;Ubuntu that was functional with 64-bit platforms. Cinelerra was a huge hit in its early years since it was a comprehensive and free video editor that was practically unique in its field. However, as time went on, progress slowed, and many users abandoned the project.</p>
<p>Currently, work is ongoing, and new Ubuntu versions are being released in stages. Cinelerra includes a split editing panel that, like Gimp, allows for non-linear video editing. Like all other video editors, Cinelerra provides a variety of video effects and transitions for producing movies and slideshows. We can get Cinelerra from Sourceforge; once we install it, we should run the program using the.&#x2F; command.</p>
<h3 id="10-Blender"><a href="#10-Blender" class="headerlink" title="10. Blender"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like Lightworks and KDenlive, this video editor is geared towards advanced users, but the greatest part is that it is free. It focuses on 3D animation rather than traditional video editing. It’s widely used in 3D modeling, visual effects, animation, simulation, pipeline, and game development.</p>
<p>Blender has filters, transitions, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >keyframes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, adjustment layers, speed control, live preview, histogram displays, luma waveform, and chroma vectorscope for video production. Aside from that, it also allows you to mix, sync, and scrub audio files.</p>
<p>Because all of these functions might be a steep learning curve, it is a little challenging for inexperienced video producers. It is, without a doubt, the finest example of a free and open-source community project. Blender is a free program found in practically any software app store.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Well, there you have it – your best <strong>Ubuntu Video Editor</strong> tools list. Using Ubuntu does not preclude you from installing high-quality apps. Except for the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> described above, there are many other Ubuntu applications available.</p>
<p>A few are geared for pros (such as Lightworks, HitFilm Express, and Blender), while others are designed for beginners (similar to Shotcut and OpenShot). Additionally, because most video editors are currently accessible on the google play store, you would be able to download and install them on your Ubuntu laptop.</p>

<h3 id="1-OpenShot-1"><a href="#1-OpenShot-1" class="headerlink" title="1. OpenShot"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openshot.org/" >OpenShot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We are confident that you will not find a more user-friendly video editor than this one. OpenShot is most likely the best choice when you’re new to video production. It is simple to use, but it also has several interesting features.</p>
<p>This editor comes with a plethora of titles and transitions and compatibility for the majority of video and picture formats. You also receive an excellent export option that allows you to save files in various formats. As already mentioned, the application is designed to meet the needs of beginning learners; yet, advanced users will not be dissatisfied because it supports high-quality video formats such as 4K.</p>
<p>OpenShot has several useful audio editing capabilities, including seeing waveforms on the timeline and even displaying the waveform as part of the film. It also allows you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >separate the sound from the video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and tune each sound channel separately.</p>
<h3 id="2-OBS-Studio-1"><a href="#2-OBS-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="2. OBS Studio"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>OBS Studio is a free, open-source tool that can be downloaded and installed on Ubuntu and other operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Because it includes a fantastic <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen capturer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, OBS Studio is becoming famous for making videos of Ubuntu or other computer programs. OBS Studio is a basic video editor that lets us blend photos, movies, and music easily.</p>
<p>OBS Studio can create movies in the following formats: Flv, Mkv, mp4, mov, ts, and m3u8. Although the formats are not very open, they are compatible with internet video publishing sites. This editor allows us to modify video rather than merely broadcast it, albeit the editing functionality is not as robust as Kdenlive or Openshot.</p>
<p>OBS Studio also links with video streaming sites to create live videos, unlike other video editing software. This has made it a highly popular software among YouTubers and one that we can download on any Ubuntu version.</p>
<h3 id="3-PiTiVi-1"><a href="#3-PiTiVi-1" class="headerlink" title="3. PiTiVi"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pitivi.org/" >PiTiVi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like many others, this one lets you perform basic video editing activities such as trimming, cutting, snapping, splitting, and mixing. The program also supports several additional languages for those who aren’t fluent in English. You should probably read the manual before using it since it contains a lot of valuable information on using this application.</p>
<p>In a word, the application provides a touch-capable, hardware-accelerated user experience. Limitless video&#x2F;audio track layers, full undo&#x2F;redo history, trimming, cutting, sound editing of several concurrent audio layers upon layer, volume keyframe curves, keyframe audio enhancements, and more are all supported.</p>
<p>Pitivi creates thumbnails and waveforms in the background to provide you with the best performance without interfering with your workflow. Pitivi may be found in most Ubuntu software repositories. If you want, you may also download pre-assembled kits.</p>

<h3 id="4-Kdenlive-1"><a href="#4-Kdenlive-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Kdenlive"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://kdenlive.org/en/" >Kdenlive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Kdenlive is, without a doubt, one of the best video editing applications for Ubuntu available right now! What sets it apart from other video editors is that it is completely free and includes several useful features. The MLT Framework, which is based on many other open-source projects, handles most of the video editing in Kdenlive, built on Qt and the KDE Frameworks libraries.</p>
<p>Adjustable layout compatibility, a clip list, a multitrack chronology, automatic backup, keyframe special effects, and transitioning are all included in this video editing program. Do you have a special file format or camcorder? Not an issue — Kdenlive works with practically anything.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Kdenlive runs on Mac OSX and FreeBSD. Proxy editing is another useful function. This handy function can produce low-quality duplicates of your source clips for quick editing and render them in full resolution.</p>
<h3 id="5-Shotcut-1"><a href="#5-Shotcut-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Shotcut"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor is Shotcut. Unlike Kdenlive, beginner video editors would obtain a comprehensive understanding of Shotcut because of its user-friendly interface. It has indigenous timeline editing, video transitions and filters, and a multitrack timeline, among other things.</p>
<p>Keyframes for digital filters and 3-point editing are supported. Shotcut is useful if you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove the audio from a video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> rapidly. Additionally, it allows you to edit audio and 4K films. Furthermore, it allows for external monitoring.</p>
<p>JACK transport sync, audio blending throughout all channels, stereo, mono, and 5.1 surround sound capabilities are supported on the audio front. Shotcut is considered ideal for beginners, and if you are one, we would highly suggest getting this one for your Ubuntu.</p>
<h3 id="6-Lightworks-1"><a href="#6-Lightworks-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Lightworks"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Because the functions go beyond the world of inexperienced editors, this video editor for Ubuntu computers is suited for specialists in video editing. The award-winning non-linear editing (NLE) program can handle 4K, Blu-Ray, and even SD and HD footage. You’ll also discover Low-Res <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Proxy workflows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for 4K and drag-and-drop support alongside those capabilities.</p>

<p>It features voice-over and just added Mackie MIDI compatibility for Ubuntu users. Lightworks supports the most analog and digital connectors, namely 12G, 3G-SDI, Optical audio, HDMI 2, and AES&#x2F;EBU connectors. The creators have also included <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional-level video editing tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and audio filters and enhancements.</p>

This <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers most of the same capabilities as top-tier production suites, featuring 4K video capability, 360-degree editing, and hundreds of special effects.</p>
<p>In reality, when it comes to editing capabilities, Hitfilm Express is extremely similar to Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p>The major disadvantage of this program is that it consumes a lot of system resources, which means it won’t run on many lightweight laptops. You’ll have to pay extra for things like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >360-degree <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> text, extra color grading facilities, and other aesthetic enhancements, among other things. Hitfilm Express is a video editor that is so strong and simple to use that it’s difficult to believe it’s free. It’s a great option for any video creator on a shoestring budget.</p>

<h3 id="9-Cinelerra-1"><a href="#9-Cinelerra-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Cinelerra"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://cinelerra.org/" >Cinelerra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Cinelerra is a video editor for GNU&#x2F;Ubuntu, first released in 1998. It was the first non-linear video editor for GNU&#x2F;Ubuntu that was functional with 64-bit platforms. Cinelerra was a huge hit in its early years since it was a comprehensive and free video editor that was practically unique in its field. However, as time went on, progress slowed, and many users abandoned the project.</p>
<p>Currently, work is ongoing, and new Ubuntu versions are being released in stages. Cinelerra includes a split editing panel that, like Gimp, allows for non-linear video editing. Like all other video editors, Cinelerra provides a variety of video effects and transitions for producing movies and slideshows. We can get Cinelerra from Sourceforge; once we install it, we should run the program using the.&#x2F; command.</p>
<h3 id="10-Blender-1"><a href="#10-Blender-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Blender"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like Lightworks and KDenlive, this video editor is geared towards advanced users, but the greatest part is that it is free. It focuses on 3D animation rather than traditional video editing. It’s widely used in 3D modeling, visual effects, animation, simulation, pipeline, and game development.</p>
<p>Blender has filters, transitions, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >keyframes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, adjustment layers, speed control, live preview, histogram displays, luma waveform, and chroma vectorscope for video production. Aside from that, it also allows you to mix, sync, and scrub audio files.</p>
<p>Because all of these functions might be a steep learning curve, it is a little challenging for inexperienced video producers. It is, without a doubt, the finest example of a free and open-source community project. Blender is a free program found in practically any software app store.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Well, there you have it – your best <strong>Ubuntu Video Editor</strong> tools list. Using Ubuntu does not preclude you from installing high-quality apps. Except for the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> described above, there are many other Ubuntu applications available.</p>
<p>A few are geared for pros (such as Lightworks, HitFilm Express, and Blender), while others are designed for beginners (similar to Shotcut and OpenShot). Additionally, because most video editors are currently accessible on the google play store, you would be able to download and install them on your Ubuntu laptop.</p>

<h3 id="1-OpenShot-2"><a href="#1-OpenShot-2" class="headerlink" title="1. OpenShot"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openshot.org/" >OpenShot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We are confident that you will not find a more user-friendly video editor than this one. OpenShot is most likely the best choice when you’re new to video production. It is simple to use, but it also has several interesting features.</p>
<p>This editor comes with a plethora of titles and transitions and compatibility for the majority of video and picture formats. You also receive an excellent export option that allows you to save files in various formats. As already mentioned, the application is designed to meet the needs of beginning learners; yet, advanced users will not be dissatisfied because it supports high-quality video formats such as 4K.</p>
<p>OpenShot has several useful audio editing capabilities, including seeing waveforms on the timeline and even displaying the waveform as part of the film. It also allows you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >separate the sound from the video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and tune each sound channel separately.</p>
<h3 id="2-OBS-Studio-2"><a href="#2-OBS-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="2. OBS Studio"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>OBS Studio is a free, open-source tool that can be downloaded and installed on Ubuntu and other operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Because it includes a fantastic <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen capturer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, OBS Studio is becoming famous for making videos of Ubuntu or other computer programs. OBS Studio is a basic video editor that lets us blend photos, movies, and music easily.</p>
<p>OBS Studio can create movies in the following formats: Flv, Mkv, mp4, mov, ts, and m3u8. Although the formats are not very open, they are compatible with internet video publishing sites. This editor allows us to modify video rather than merely broadcast it, albeit the editing functionality is not as robust as Kdenlive or Openshot.</p>
<p>OBS Studio also links with video streaming sites to create live videos, unlike other video editing software. This has made it a highly popular software among YouTubers and one that we can download on any Ubuntu version.</p>
<h3 id="3-PiTiVi-2"><a href="#3-PiTiVi-2" class="headerlink" title="3. PiTiVi"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pitivi.org/" >PiTiVi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like many others, this one lets you perform basic video editing activities such as trimming, cutting, snapping, splitting, and mixing. The program also supports several additional languages for those who aren’t fluent in English. You should probably read the manual before using it since it contains a lot of valuable information on using this application.</p>
<p>In a word, the application provides a touch-capable, hardware-accelerated user experience. Limitless video&#x2F;audio track layers, full undo&#x2F;redo history, trimming, cutting, sound editing of several concurrent audio layers upon layer, volume keyframe curves, keyframe audio enhancements, and more are all supported.</p>
<p>Pitivi creates thumbnails and waveforms in the background to provide you with the best performance without interfering with your workflow. Pitivi may be found in most Ubuntu software repositories. If you want, you may also download pre-assembled kits.</p>

<h3 id="4-Kdenlive-2"><a href="#4-Kdenlive-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Kdenlive"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://kdenlive.org/en/" >Kdenlive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Kdenlive is, without a doubt, one of the best video editing applications for Ubuntu available right now! What sets it apart from other video editors is that it is completely free and includes several useful features. The MLT Framework, which is based on many other open-source projects, handles most of the video editing in Kdenlive, built on Qt and the KDE Frameworks libraries.</p>
<p>Adjustable layout compatibility, a clip list, a multitrack chronology, automatic backup, keyframe special effects, and transitioning are all included in this video editing program. Do you have a special file format or camcorder? Not an issue — Kdenlive works with practically anything.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Kdenlive runs on Mac OSX and FreeBSD. Proxy editing is another useful function. This handy function can produce low-quality duplicates of your source clips for quick editing and render them in full resolution.</p>
<h3 id="5-Shotcut-2"><a href="#5-Shotcut-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Shotcut"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor is Shotcut. Unlike Kdenlive, beginner video editors would obtain a comprehensive understanding of Shotcut because of its user-friendly interface. It has indigenous timeline editing, video transitions and filters, and a multitrack timeline, among other things.</p>
<p>Keyframes for digital filters and 3-point editing are supported. Shotcut is useful if you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove the audio from a video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> rapidly. Additionally, it allows you to edit audio and 4K films. Furthermore, it allows for external monitoring.</p>
<p>JACK transport sync, audio blending throughout all channels, stereo, mono, and 5.1 surround sound capabilities are supported on the audio front. Shotcut is considered ideal for beginners, and if you are one, we would highly suggest getting this one for your Ubuntu.</p>
<h3 id="6-Lightworks-2"><a href="#6-Lightworks-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Lightworks"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Because the functions go beyond the world of inexperienced editors, this video editor for Ubuntu computers is suited for specialists in video editing. The award-winning non-linear editing (NLE) program can handle 4K, Blu-Ray, and even SD and HD footage. You’ll also discover Low-Res <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Proxy workflows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for 4K and drag-and-drop support alongside those capabilities.</p>

<p>It features voice-over and just added Mackie MIDI compatibility for Ubuntu users. Lightworks supports the most analog and digital connectors, namely 12G, 3G-SDI, Optical audio, HDMI 2, and AES&#x2F;EBU connectors. The creators have also included <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional-level video editing tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and audio filters and enhancements.</p>

This <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers most of the same capabilities as top-tier production suites, featuring 4K video capability, 360-degree editing, and hundreds of special effects.</p>
<p>In reality, when it comes to editing capabilities, Hitfilm Express is extremely similar to Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p>The major disadvantage of this program is that it consumes a lot of system resources, which means it won’t run on many lightweight laptops. You’ll have to pay extra for things like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >360-degree <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> text, extra color grading facilities, and other aesthetic enhancements, among other things. Hitfilm Express is a video editor that is so strong and simple to use that it’s difficult to believe it’s free. It’s a great option for any video creator on a shoestring budget.</p>

We can get Cinelerra from Sourceforge; once we install it, we should run the program using the.&#x2F; command.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Well, there you have it – your best <strong>Ubuntu Video Editor</strong> tools list. Using Ubuntu does not preclude you from installing high-quality apps. Except for the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> described above, there are many other Ubuntu applications available.</p>
<p>A few are geared for pros (such as Lightworks, HitFilm Express, and Blender), while others are designed for beginners (similar to Shotcut and OpenShot). Additionally, because most video editors are currently accessible on the google play store, you would be able to download and install them on your Ubuntu laptop.</p>

<h3 id="1-OpenShot-3"><a href="#1-OpenShot-3" class="headerlink" title="1. OpenShot"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openshot.org/" >OpenShot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We are confident that you will not find a more user-friendly video editor than this one. OpenShot is most likely the best choice when you’re new to video production. It is simple to use, but it also has several interesting features.</p>
<p>This editor comes with a plethora of titles and transitions and compatibility for the majority of video and picture formats. You also receive an excellent export option that allows you to save files in various formats. As already mentioned, the application is designed to meet the needs of beginning learners; yet, advanced users will not be dissatisfied because it supports high-quality video formats such as 4K.</p>
<p>OpenShot has several useful audio editing capabilities, including seeing waveforms on the timeline and even displaying the waveform as part of the film. It also allows you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >separate the sound from the video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and tune each sound channel separately.</p>
<h3 id="2-OBS-Studio-3"><a href="#2-OBS-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="2. OBS Studio"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>OBS Studio is a free, open-source tool that can be downloaded and installed on Ubuntu and other operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Because it includes a fantastic <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen capturer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, OBS Studio is becoming famous for making videos of Ubuntu or other computer programs. OBS Studio is a basic video editor that lets us blend photos, movies, and music easily.</p>
<p>OBS Studio can create movies in the following formats: Flv, Mkv, mp4, mov, ts, and m3u8. Although the formats are not very open, they are compatible with internet video publishing sites. This editor allows us to modify video rather than merely broadcast it, albeit the editing functionality is not as robust as Kdenlive or Openshot.</p>
<p>OBS Studio also links with video streaming sites to create live videos, unlike other video editing software. This has made it a highly popular software among YouTubers and one that we can download on any Ubuntu version.</p>
<h3 id="3-PiTiVi-3"><a href="#3-PiTiVi-3" class="headerlink" title="3. PiTiVi"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pitivi.org/" >PiTiVi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Like many others, this one lets you perform basic video editing activities such as trimming, cutting, snapping, splitting, and mixing. The program also supports several additional languages for those who aren’t fluent in English. You should probably read the manual before using it since it contains a lot of valuable information on using this application.</p>
<p>In a word, the application provides a touch-capable, hardware-accelerated user experience. Limitless video&#x2F;audio track layers, full undo&#x2F;redo history, trimming, cutting, sound editing of several concurrent audio layers upon layer, volume keyframe curves, keyframe audio enhancements, and more are all supported.</p>
<p>Pitivi creates thumbnails and waveforms in the background to provide you with the best performance without interfering with your workflow. Pitivi may be found in most Ubuntu software repositories. If you want, you may also download pre-assembled kits.</p>

<h3 id="4-Kdenlive-3"><a href="#4-Kdenlive-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Kdenlive"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://kdenlive.org/en/" >Kdenlive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Kdenlive is, without a doubt, one of the best video editing applications for Ubuntu available right now! What sets it apart from other video editors is that it is completely free and includes several useful features. The MLT Framework, which is based on many other open-source projects, handles most of the video editing in Kdenlive, built on Qt and the KDE Frameworks libraries.</p>
<p>Adjustable layout compatibility, a clip list, a multitrack chronology, automatic backup, keyframe special effects, and transitioning are all included in this video editing program. Do you have a special file format or camcorder? Not an issue — Kdenlive works with practically anything.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Kdenlive runs on Mac OSX and FreeBSD. Proxy editing is another useful function. This handy function can produce low-quality duplicates of your source clips for quick editing and render them in full resolution.</p>
<h3 id="5-Shotcut-3"><a href="#5-Shotcut-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Shotcut"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor is Shotcut. Unlike Kdenlive, beginner video editors would obtain a comprehensive understanding of Shotcut because of its user-friendly interface. It has indigenous timeline editing, video transitions and filters, and a multitrack timeline, among other things.</p>
<p>Keyframes for digital filters and 3-point editing are supported. Shotcut is useful if you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove the audio from a video clip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> rapidly. Additionally, it allows you to edit audio and 4K films. Furthermore, it allows for external monitoring.</p>
<p>JACK transport sync, audio blending throughout all channels, stereo, mono, and 5.1 surround sound capabilities are supported on the audio front. Shotcut is considered ideal for beginners, and if you are one, we would highly suggest getting this one for your Ubuntu.</p>
<h3 id="6-Lightworks-3"><a href="#6-Lightworks-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Lightworks"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Because the functions go beyond the world of inexperienced editors, this video editor for Ubuntu computers is suited for specialists in video editing. The award-winning non-linear editing (NLE) program can handle 4K, Blu-Ray, and even SD and HD footage. You’ll also discover Low-Res <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Proxy workflows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for 4K and drag-and-drop support alongside those capabilities.</p>

<p>It features voice-over and just added Mackie MIDI compatibility for Ubuntu users. Lightworks supports the most analog and digital connectors, namely 12G, 3G-SDI, Optical audio, HDMI 2, and AES&#x2F;EBU connectors. The creators have also included <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional-level video editing tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and audio filters and enhancements.</p>

<p>In reality, when it comes to editing capabilities, Hitfilm Express is extremely similar to Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p>The major disadvantage of this program is that it consumes a lot of system resources, which means it won’t run on many lightweight laptops. You’ll have to pay extra for things like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >360-degree <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> text, extra color grading facilities, and other aesthetic enhancements, among other things. Hitfilm Express is a video editor that is so strong and simple to use that it’s difficult to believe it’s free. It’s a great option for any video creator on a shoestring budget.</p>

It was the first non-linear video editor for GNU&#x2F;Ubuntu that was functional with 64-bit platforms. Cinelerra was a huge hit in its early years since it was a comprehensive and free video editor that was practically unique in its field.

Many of you usually don’t bother until you get an alert that the disk is full.</p>
<p>Sometimes the largest drives get filled eventually. If you haven’t checked your disk space yet, use your Mac and follow the instructions given below. You may be surprised about how much space can FCPX take.</p>
<p>Here is how you will do it:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: Checking the mac storage through “About this Mac”</strong></p>
<p>Now it is a bit easy to check the storage from about the section. You will find this in most of the recent MAC versions.</p>
<p>Click on the mac logo and then click on “About this mac”.</p>
<p>Click on “storage” and you will see a reference chart stacked portraying the capacity of the disk and the absolute amount of storage taken by different categories of information. Moreover, you will find out the space that is yet accessible to you.</p>
<p> <strong>Option 2: Checking the mac storage through “Disk utility”</strong></p>
<p>If you’re a Mac user, you might know that there is a disk utility app. You can easily get a readout of the available space from there.</p>
<p>Open your Finder and click “Applications” on the left side.</p>
<p>Or click the magnifying glass in the upper right to find disk utility.</p>
<p>You will find utilities in Applications. <strong>Applications&gt; utilities</strong>.</p>
<p>After the disk utility opens, you can see the available used spaces. Remember to put your hard drive’s name from the list. The popup window that opens up will also tell you the free space of any device connected to your Mac.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Finder and select Finder&gt;Preferences, next Click General, modify the settings and you will see the storage device on the desktop.</li>
<li>To check the available or remaining space, click the spacebar. As you click it a window popup will show you the remaining space.</li>
