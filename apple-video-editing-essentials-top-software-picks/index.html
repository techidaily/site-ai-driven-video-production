Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.</p>
<p>In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.</p>
<h3 id="1-Photos"><a href="#1-Photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Photos"></a>1. Photos</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPadOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>The number one on our list is the Photos app. It’s among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Photos App?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.</p>
<p>Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to <strong>add text</strong>, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can <strong>rotate, crop and auto enhance</strong> videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap <strong>Revert</strong> to restore to the original version.</p>
<p>If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can <strong>adjust the focus points and the depth of the field</strong> in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo’s time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.</p>
<h3 id="2-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#2-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickTime Player"></a>2. QuickTime Player</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that’s not to say this one doesn’t have excellent features to offer.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trim, Combine,</strong> <strong>Rotate, Split MOV Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature.

<ul>
<li><strong>Record Screen and Voiceover</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shrink Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe your video looks better with a small size in appearance, try shrinking it using the shrink feature in the QuickTime Player. You can lower the video quality from 1080p, 720p to whatever your phone or Mac storage deems compatible.</p>
<h3 id="3-Clips"><a href="#3-Clips" class="headerlink" title="3. Clips"></a>3. Clips</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to Use</p>
<p>You might not have heard of Clips as much as you may have heard about the others on this list. But don’t sleep on this one. Clips have slowly but surely gained the attraction of expert video editors, and you’d see almost all of them having Clips on their iPhones or Macs.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Clips?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Clips is interesting to check out when you’re an iOS fan. You can use this free video editing app to record and edit 16:9, 4:3 or square videos with various camera effects, stunning filters, animated text, music, emoji, stickers, and more, and then share it with your friends or family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family-Oriented</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>AR Spaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips, for instance, introduced AR Spaces, an augmented reality function for iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro owners, in April.</p>
<ul>

<p>Furthermore, the most recent version in September enables you to import and edit video shot in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 and ProRes footage from the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>One of the most recognizable apps in the Apple market for video editing software is the iMovie app. Almost all professional experts are reaping the benefits of using the iMovie app. The app developers have emphasized greatly equipping the professionals and the newbies who so desperately want to make their mark into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with iMovie?</strong></p>
<p>iMovie, is more like Final Cut Pro X’s younger sibling. But it’s free with your Mac, so there’s no danger in giving it a shot. It’s an excellent option for newcomers learning to use editing software, casual enthusiasts, and even YouTubers who wish to cut up their films.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Merge, Cut, Trim: Pull off Everything!</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>4K Video Editing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may even export your work in 4K quality at up to 60 frames per second once you’ve done it. Many effects, transitions, filters, and fine-tuning settings for white balance, color matching, and audio isolation are also included.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In September, iMovie received a major upgrade, which included importing and editing footage taken in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 to Macs. You may now add, tweak, and delete focus points, as well as change the depths of field effect in a video shot in Cinematic mode, assuming you have a modern iPhone or iPad.</p>

In addition, you do not need to register an account to download the images. The sites typically rely on user contributions and content teams to ensure their databases are fresh and maintain consistent quality. Furthermore, all creative assets they offer fall under the creative commons zero license or a variation of it. Here are some of the sites that offer you images for commercial use for free.</p>

<p>Pexels.com is a free-to-use provider of high-resolution photos and videos for aspiring creators. The German-based website was started in 2014 by two brothers and has been under the Canva umbrella since 2018.</p>
<p>Currently, the website hosts over 3.2 million images and videos from over 250,000 active contributors. In addition, all the material you find in its library is under the Pexels license, which slightly varies from the creative commons zero license model. Some of the restrictions it enforces include:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can only use pexels images for commercial use after making alterations to the original image. For example, you can use part of an image to create a collage for your commercial branding.</li>
<li>Furthermore, you cannot use any of the website’s content to promote political ideologies and explicit content, especially if the images contain identifiable subjects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pexels is available through the following channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your web browser by typing the URL pexels.com.</li>
<li>The Android and iOS app.</li>
<li>A plugin for other content creation software such as Google Slides and MS Office.</li>
<li>An extension on your Chrome browser.</li>
<li>You can also access the database using the official Canva app.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-Unsplash"><a href="#2-Unsplash" class="headerlink" title="2. Unsplash"></a>2. Unsplash</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>Another website that offers free images for commercial use is Unsplash, a subsidiary of Getty Images since 2021. The website is a favorite among creators boasting over 16 billion photo impressions monthly. In addition, the database consists of over 3.48 million photos from more than 265,000 unique contributors, all under the Unsplash license.</p>
<p>The Unsplash license restricts the sale of its creative assets without incorporating new creative elements, including using them in print media and physical goods such as mugs and caps.</p>
<p>You can access Unsplash from your web browser or request API integration for your application from the site’s owners. In addition, the site also hosts photo walks across different cities, where Unsplash guides show you the best photo locations around the city and the best camera techniques for your work. Some cities to host the event include Boston, Montreal, Tokyo, and Toronto.</p>
<h3 id="3-Freerange"><a href="#3-Freerange" class="headerlink" title="3. Freerange"></a>3. Freerange</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>Freerange Stock is an online resource for photos, illustrations, and textures you can download and use for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Since 2007, the site has continued to provide high-quality images to its community of over 800,000 registered users.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous examples, all content on Freerange falls under the website’s Equalicense. It grants you broad commercial rights of its stock images while allowing the contributors to retain control of their copyright, image resale, and distribution. As such, you cannot use the images for bulk distribution or print-on-demand works.</p>
<p>Freerange Stock maintains its steady supply of images for commercial use via the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has an in-house team of professional photographers who upload images across the different categories on the website.</li>
<li>Freerange Stock also purchases image rights or directly commissions photos from independent creators.</li>
<li>You can also contribute to the website’s library by voluntarily submitting your work to the platform. Kindly note that you will need a verified account to enable this function.</li>
<li>The website also works directly with photographers through a licensing and distribution model, providing them extra exposure on the site.</li>
<li>Finally, Freerange stock aggregates public domain images from other sources, including similar sites and government institutions. It does so by acknowledging the image owner and sometimes lists the image source when the owner is unknown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Freerange Stock is accessible through your web browser or as an API integration on your app.</p>
<h3 id="4-Vecteezy"><a href="#4-Vecteezy" class="headerlink" title="4. Vecteezy"></a>4. Vecteezy</h3><p><img

                      alt="vecteezy"
                ></p>
<p>Vecteezy is an extensive online library of free stock images for commercial use. Some of the site’s highlight features include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A best-in-class search engine that incorporates multiple filters to ensure your results are extremely accurate. For example, you can sort images by color, style, number of people, and age of the subjects, something other free stock websites do not provide.</li>
<li>All images, videos, and vector illustrations are free for personal and commercial uses. It does so through a property sign and release model with its extensive network of contributors, which protects users from any legal liabilities.</li>
<li>Finally, it employs a content team that manually reviews each photo submission to ensure consistent quality standards for its offerings.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you can also purchase design resource bundles by subscribing to its Vecteezy pro for as little as $9 monthly. Some of the resources available include the Ultimate Text Effects Layer Styles Bundle for Photoshop, which costs $39 stand-alone or $4.50 when you subscribe to pro.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Buy-from-stock-providers"><a href="#Part-2-Buy-from-stock-providers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Buy from stock providers"></a>Part 2: Buy from stock providers</h2><p>Another way to get images for commercial use is by buying them from stock providers. Some of the benefits of buying images from stock providers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get a wide selection of unique photos from top-tier photographers. Stock providers always seek collaborations with the industry’s finest to edge out the competition.</li>
<li>You receive exemplary customer service with your purchase. Selecting the right image can be confusing for amateur creators. As such, stock image providers have customer support channels to help you throughout your creative process.</li>
<li>Stock images reduce your delivery times significantly. Buying images from a stock provider eliminates the need to invest in photography equipment and the time you need for post-production. As such, you can deliver projects in a fast and cost-effective way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the above positive, here are some challenges that buying stock images may present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all stock image providers will have the creative assets you need.</li>
<li>Image overuse is likely since every creator will rush for the most popular contributor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some of the stock image providers you should consider.</p>
<h3 id="1-iStock"><a href="#1-iStock" class="headerlink" title="1. iStock"></a>1. iStock</h3><p>iStockphoto.com is an online database of creative resources, including royalty-free photos, videos, audio, illustrations, and clip art you can use in your creations. The website is a Getty Images subsidiary based in Calgary, Canada. In addition, contributors earn royalties depending on how often users download their content.</p>
<h3 id="2-Alamy-com"><a href="#2-Alamy-com" class="headerlink" title="2. Alamy.com"></a>2. Alamy.com</h3><p>Alamy.com is a British-owned stock image provider with contributions from photographers and agencies in 173 countries. It compensates its contributors by offering higher than average payouts every time users download their creations. Some popular brands to use Alamy’s services include M&amp;C Saatchi, Microsoft, and The Economist.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Shot-a-Photo-by-yourself-or-create-one-with-editing-tools"><a href="#Part-3-Shot-a-Photo-by-yourself-or-create-one-with-editing-tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Shot a Photo by yourself or create one with editing tools"></a>Part 3: Shot a Photo by yourself or create one with editing tools</h2><p>Alternatively, you can get images for commercial use by shooting them yourself or creating them with editing tools such as Figma and Wondershare’s Filmstock. Here are some benefits of using this method:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get exactly what you want, provided you have the required skills and equipment. Sometimes, getting the right image for your commercial purpose can be challenging. As such, shooting an original photo may be the only option.</li>
<li>You have full ownership of the image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike obtaining images from stock photography websites, you are free to use the image in whatever capacity you please without any restrictions. For example, sites such as Unsplash do not allow you to use their images in political statements, a restriction you can bypass when using your own creations.</p>
<p>However, you should also consider the following factors when using this method.</p>
<h3 id="It-requires-a-substantial-investment"><a href="#It-requires-a-substantial-investment" class="headerlink" title="It requires a substantial investment"></a>It requires a substantial investment</h3><p>Getting high-quality images for commercial purposes requires specialist equipment. For example, the Panasonic LUMIX GH6 camera, which has 4K resolution capability, costs $2,197 on Amazon. This makes it extremely expensive for amateur creators.</p>
<h3 id="There-is-a-steep-learning-curve"><a href="#There-is-a-steep-learning-curve" class="headerlink" title="There is a steep learning curve"></a>There is a steep learning curve</h3><p>Becoming a professional photographer takes time and effort. Unless you are creating as a hobby, it will be a while before you can start generating income from your creations.</p>

Do you need a contributor account to get images for commercial use?"></a>1. Do you need a contributor account to get images for commercial use?</h3><p>Not necessarily. Stock image sites like pexels.com allow you to download images from their website without creating an account. You will only need one if you want to showcase your work on the platform.</p>
<h3 id="2-Can-you-use-your-smartphone-to-get-images-for-commercial-use"><a href="#2-Can-you-use-your-smartphone-to-get-images-for-commercial-use" class="headerlink" title="2.

Most stock image providers have device-specific apps that allow you to access their databases from your mobile device. For example, UnsplashPhotoPicker allows you access to the Unsplash library from your Android device.</p>

<p>Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it’s usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it’s not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it’s too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize footage</strong>? Let’s find out!</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE</a></p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Stabilize-Video-with-Built-in-Warp-Stabilizer-in-AE"><a href="#Part-1-Stabilize-Video-with-Built-in-Warp-Stabilizer-in-AE" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE"></a>Part 1: Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE</h2><p>The Warp Stabilizer effect is a new technique to cope with unsteady video. In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect’s essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects &amp; Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for “<strong>Warp</strong>“ in the search box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-effects-presets-pane.jpg"
                      alt="after effects effects presets pane"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’ve identified <strong>Warp Stabilizer</strong>, you’ll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-warp-stabilizer-vfx.jpg"
                      alt="after effects warp stabilizer vfx"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.</p>
<p>(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After stabilization, use the spacebar to begin a RAM peek. Choose the layer you added to and click to display the drop-down menu or go to the Effects Control panel whenever you need to tweak the stabilizing effect.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE"><a href="#Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE"></a>Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE</h2><p>Using Stabilize Motion feature to stabilize video is an old-school heritage function from the era of the Creative Suite, it will still be there in After Effects presently and performs admirably.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The tracker panel is most likely open by default in your edition of After Effects, but if it isn’t, go to <strong>Window</strong> in the top menu to open it. Once you’ve arrived here, scroll to the bottom until you locate <strong>Tracker</strong> and double-check that it has a checkbox beside it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-tracker-pane.jpg"
                      alt="after effects tracker pane"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Stabilize Motion from the drop-down menu whenever the tracker panel is open. You’ll see that a tracker box appears in your <strong>Layer Panel</strong> once you’ve done this.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: You’ll need to identify a proper location in your film for the tracker to operate at this stage. We’re monitoring a vehicle using a camera operator’s drone in the instance below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-tracker-track-motion.jpg"
                      alt="after effects tracker track motion"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Let’s press the <strong>Play</strong> button on the tracker panel once we’ve set up the tracker box. The tracker box should adhere to the location or item you chose when you do this.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: When your tracking points start to go astray, use the <strong>Pause</strong> button, personally modify the tracking point, and then push play to resume the journey).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-effects-track-motion-effects.jpg"
                      alt="adobe effects track motion effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When the tracker is done and satisfied with the results, click <strong>Edit target</strong> to verify that the tracking data is transferred to the correct layer. Then proceed to the bottom of the page and click the <strong>Apply</strong> option.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong> A dialogue window with choices for applying them. Usually, you’ll want to choose <strong>X and Y</strong> here).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-target-track-motion-feature.jpg"
                      alt="edit target track motion feature"
                ></p>
<p>Hit the spacebar to evaluate how well the stabilize motion tracker performed now when you’re back in the composition window. When you’re not pleased with the outcomes, you might have to go back to try again. Although this approach is best used for photos with a clear point of focus that doesn’t go out of frame, it could still be helpful in some situations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Using-Stabilization-Plugins-for-Smoother-Video-in-AE"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Stabilization-Plugins-for-Smoother-Video-in-AE" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Using Stabilization Plugins for Smoother Video in AE"></a>Part 3: Using Stabilization Plugins for Smoother Video in AE</h2><p>As a graphic and motion designer, animator, or 3D artist, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >After Effects plugins <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may completely change the way you operate. Since it can handle so much right out of the box, Adobe After Effects CC is already a go-to motion graphic and compositing program for many artists.</p>
<p>However, as with any good program, third-party plugins could only help you take your work to the next level by adding new features or streamlining your process.</p>
<p>It should be unsurprising that After Effects has many plugins for a program that is over 30 years old. Here are the best stabilization plugins for smoother video in AE:</p>
<h3 id="1-Orb"><a href="#1-Orb" class="headerlink" title="1. Orb"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.videocopilot.net/orb/" >Orb <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Orb is focused on generating realistic planets and includes a range of unique features to make planetary creation easy. It utilizes a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot’s great Element 3D plugin, and it employs a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot’s outstanding Element 3D plugin.</p>
<p>You would believe that making planets in 3D is simple —create a circle, add textures, and you’re done! Getting a world to ‘look’ properly, on the other hand, might be more complicated than it appears.</p>
<p>For example, how can the line between night and day be altered in a model of a populated planet such that cities may be visible at night but not during the day?</p>
<p>Although Orb doesn’t work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.</p>
<h3 id="2-Depth-of-Field-Generator-PRO-DOF-PRO"><a href="#2-Depth-of-Field-Generator-PRO-DOF-PRO" class="headerlink" title="2. Depth of Field Generator PRO (DOF PRO)"></a>2. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://richardrosenman.com/shop/dof-pro-ae/"><strong>Depth of Field Generator PRO (DOF PRO)</strong></a></h3><p>Richard Rosenman’s renowned Photoshop depth of field generator plugin, DOF PRO (Depth of Field Generator PRO), is now downloadable for After Effects. DOF PRO has become the industry’s professional option for an unprecedented and complex depth of field effects rapidly and effectively as a post-process.</p>
<p>This is thanks to almost a decade of discovery and application since the first launch in 2005. DOF PRO’s cutting-edge characteristics offer new and advanced technologies not found anywhere else, resulting in one of the industry’s most potent and sophisticated depth of field processors.</p>
<p>Capability for chromatic and achromatic aberration, focal plane bokeh distinction, astigmatism and vignetting effects, bespoke aperture maps, and noise recovery are among the advanced features.</p>
<p>There will also be compatibility with the alpha channel and transparency, 32-bit floating-point color, correct aperture displays, and an iris array display. A feature comparison between the plugin and After Effects’ Camera Lens Blur effect can be found here.</p>
<h3 id="3-ReelSteady"><a href="#3-ReelSteady" class="headerlink" title="3. ReelSteady"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reelsteady.com/" >ReelSteady <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>ReelSteady for After Effects is a recent addition to the stabilization marketplace. ReelSteady is similar to After Effects’ warp stabilizer plugin. However, the stabilization in ReelSteady is far superior.</p>
<p>ReelSteady also has several other features that make it ideal for creating next-level tunes. Users may design filters to block off specific sections of your frame. This is useful for removing a subject that travels around the frame a lot.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the After Effects plugin is pretty similar to the warp stabilizer but with a few more features. To begin with, ReelSteady includes a built-in rolling shutter repair tool that operates in tandem with its built-in stabilizer.</p>
<p>The ReelSteady effect is a two-pass effect. For instance, after the effect has been executed for the first time, you will likely wish to level out certain places. You’ll successfully isolate specific parts in the effect to “iron out” sections of the footage.</p>
<p>You would like to record your film at a more excellent resolution than your expected outcome to get the most out of ReelSteady. If you wish to output your video in 4K, you might capture it in 4.6K or 5K. You’ll have some leeway for ReelSteady to work its magic.</p>
<p>ReelSteady’s sole flaw is its high price ($399). ReelSteady is not available in After Effects, unlike some of the other choices on this list. ReelSteady, on the other hand, is the way to go if you would like the smoothest footage imaginable.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it’s done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.</p>
<p>However, occasionally those tools aren’t available, and the outcome is questionable. That is why we decided to compile this article to add to the knowledge of our readers how they can use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize videos</strong> to enhance their video content!</p>

<p>However, as with any good program, third-party plugins could only help you take your work to the next level by adding new features or streamlining your process.</p>
<p>It should be unsurprising that After Effects has many plugins for a program that is over 30 years old. Here are the best stabilization plugins for smoother video in AE:</p>

<p>You would believe that making planets in 3D is simple —create a circle, add textures, and you’re done! Getting a world to ‘look’ properly, on the other hand, might be more complicated than it appears.</p>
<p>For example, how can the line between night and day be altered in a model of a populated planet such that cities may be visible at night but not during the day?</p>
<p>Although Orb doesn’t work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it’s done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.</p>
<p>However, occasionally those tools aren’t available, and the outcome is questionable. That is why we decided to compile this article to add to the knowledge of our readers how they can use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize videos</strong> to enhance their video content!</p>

<p>Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it’s usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it’s not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it’s too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize footage</strong>? Let’s find out!</p>

In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect’s essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects &amp; Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for “<strong>Warp</strong>“ in the search box.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="after effects effects presets pane"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’ve identified <strong>Warp Stabilizer</strong>, you’ll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="after effects warp stabilizer vfx"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.</p>
<p>(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After stabilization, use the spacebar to begin a RAM peek. Choose the layer you added to and click to display the drop-down menu or go to the Effects Control panel whenever you need to tweak the stabilizing effect.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE-2"><a href="#Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE"></a>Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE</h2><p>Using Stabilize Motion feature to stabilize video is an old-school heritage function from the era of the Creative Suite, it will still be there in After Effects presently and performs admirably.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The tracker panel is most likely open by default in your edition of After Effects, but if it isn’t, go to <strong>Window</strong> in the top menu to open it. Once you’ve arrived here, scroll to the bottom until you locate <strong>Tracker</strong> and double-check that it has a checkbox beside it.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE-3"><a href="#Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE"></a>Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE</h2><p>Using Stabilize Motion feature to stabilize video is an old-school heritage function from the era of the Creative Suite, it will still be there in After Effects presently and performs admirably.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The tracker panel is most likely open by default in your edition of After Effects, but if it isn’t, go to <strong>Window</strong> in the top menu to open it. Once you’ve arrived here, scroll to the bottom until you locate <strong>Tracker</strong> and double-check that it has a checkbox beside it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-tracker-pane.jpg"
                      alt="after effects tracker pane"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Stabilize Motion from the drop-down menu whenever the tracker panel is open. You’ll see that a tracker box appears in your <strong>Layer Panel</strong> once you’ve done this.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: You’ll need to identify a proper location in your film for the tracker to operate at this stage. We’re monitoring a vehicle using a camera operator’s drone in the instance below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-tracker-track-motion.jpg"
                      alt="after effects tracker track motion"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Let’s press the <strong>Play</strong> button on the tracker panel once we’ve set up the tracker box. The tracker box should adhere to the location or item you chose when you do this.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: When your tracking points start to go astray, use the <strong>Pause</strong> button, personally modify the tracking point, and then push play to resume the journey).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-effects-track-motion-effects.jpg"
                      alt="adobe effects track motion effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When the tracker is done and satisfied with the results, click <strong>Edit target</strong> to verify that the tracking data is transferred to the correct layer. Then proceed to the bottom of the page and click the <strong>Apply</strong> option.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong> A dialogue window with choices for applying them. Usually, you’ll want to choose <strong>X and Y</strong> here).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-target-track-motion-feature.jpg"
                      alt="edit target track motion feature"
                ></p>
<p>Hit the spacebar to evaluate how well the stabilize motion tracker performed now when you’re back in the composition window. When you’re not pleased with the outcomes, you might have to go back to try again. Although this approach is best used for photos with a clear point of focus that doesn’t go out of frame, it could still be helpful in some situations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Using-Stabilization-Plugins-for-Smoother-Video-in-AE-3"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Stabilization-Plugins-for-Smoother-Video-in-AE-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Using Stabilization Plugins for Smoother Video in AE"></a>Part 3: Using Stabilization Plugins for Smoother Video in AE</h2><p>As a graphic and motion designer, animator, or 3D artist, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >After Effects plugins <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may completely change the way you operate. Since it can handle so much right out of the box, Adobe After Effects CC is already a go-to motion graphic and compositing program for many artists.</p>
<p>However, as with any good program, third-party plugins could only help you take your work to the next level by adding new features or streamlining your process.</p>
<p>It should be unsurprising that After Effects has many plugins for a program that is over 30 years old. Here are the best stabilization plugins for smoother video in AE:</p>
<h3 id="1-Orb-3"><a href="#1-Orb-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Orb"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.videocopilot.net/orb/" >Orb <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Orb is focused on generating realistic planets and includes a range of unique features to make planetary creation easy. It utilizes a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot’s great Element 3D plugin, and it employs a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot’s outstanding Element 3D plugin.</p>
<p>You would believe that making planets in 3D is simple —create a circle, add textures, and you’re done! Getting a world to ‘look’ properly, on the other hand, might be more complicated than it appears.</p>
<p>For example, how can the line between night and day be altered in a model of a populated planet such that cities may be visible at night but not during the day?</p>
<p>Although Orb doesn’t work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.</p>
<h3 id="2-Depth-of-Field-Generator-PRO-DOF-PRO-3"><a href="#2-Depth-of-Field-Generator-PRO-DOF-PRO-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Depth of Field Generator PRO (DOF PRO)"></a>2. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://richardrosenman.com/shop/dof-pro-ae/"><strong>Depth of Field Generator PRO (DOF PRO)</strong></a></h3><p>Richard Rosenman’s renowned Photoshop depth of field generator plugin, DOF PRO (Depth of Field Generator PRO), is now downloadable for After Effects. DOF PRO has become the industry’s professional option for an unprecedented and complex depth of field effects rapidly and effectively as a post-process.</p>
<p>This is thanks to almost a decade of discovery and application since the first launch in 2005. DOF PRO’s cutting-edge characteristics offer new and advanced technologies not found anywhere else, resulting in one of the industry’s most potent and sophisticated depth of field processors.</p>
<p>Capability for chromatic and achromatic aberration, focal plane bokeh distinction, astigmatism and vignetting effects, bespoke aperture maps, and noise recovery are among the advanced features.</p>
<p>There will also be compatibility with the alpha channel and transparency, 32-bit floating-point color, correct aperture displays, and an iris array display. A feature comparison between the plugin and After Effects’ Camera Lens Blur effect can be found here.</p>
<h3 id="3-ReelSteady-3"><a href="#3-ReelSteady-3" class="headerlink" title="3. ReelSteady"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reelsteady.com/" >ReelSteady <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>ReelSteady for After Effects is a recent addition to the stabilization marketplace. ReelSteady is similar to After Effects’ warp stabilizer plugin. However, the stabilization in ReelSteady is far superior.</p>
<p>ReelSteady also has several other features that make it ideal for creating next-level tunes. Users may design filters to block off specific sections of your frame. This is useful for removing a subject that travels around the frame a lot.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the After Effects plugin is pretty similar to the warp stabilizer but with a few more features. To begin with, ReelSteady includes a built-in rolling shutter repair tool that operates in tandem with its built-in stabilizer.</p>
<p>The ReelSteady effect is a two-pass effect. For instance, after the effect has been executed for the first time, you will likely wish to level out certain places. You’ll successfully isolate specific parts in the effect to “iron out” sections of the footage.</p>
<p>You would like to record your film at a more excellent resolution than your expected outcome to get the most out of ReelSteady. If you wish to output your video in 4K, you might capture it in 4.6K or 5K. You’ll have some leeway for ReelSteady to work its magic.</p>
<p>ReelSteady’s sole flaw is its high price ($399). ReelSteady is not available in After Effects, unlike some of the other choices on this list. ReelSteady, on the other hand, is the way to go if you would like the smoothest footage imaginable.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it’s done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.</p>
<p>However, occasionally those tools aren’t available, and the outcome is questionable. That is why we decided to compile this article to add to the knowledge of our readers how they can use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize videos</strong> to enhance their video content!</p>
