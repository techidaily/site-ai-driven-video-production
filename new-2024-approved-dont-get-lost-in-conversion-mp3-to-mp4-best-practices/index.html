<p>Keeping in mind that there will of course be no actual imagery to go with the finished product (unless you choose to add as such), converting an <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> is very easy!</p>
<p>There are even online <strong>MP3 to MP4 converters</strong> that will allow you to do this without having to download or install anything! But, we’re getting ahead of ourselves here. Continue reading below to learn more:</p>

There will be two examples given for this, one for the straightforward <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> conversion the other for the more specified <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong> conversion!</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-MP4"><a href="#01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-MP4" class="headerlink" title="01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?"></a>01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?</h3><p><strong>Step 1: Launch MP3 to MP4 Convert (for Windows)</strong></p>
<p>For our example, we’ll be using the <strong>free MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, EaseUS Video Converter! This is open-source software, so you can use it for free!</p>
<p>To start using your chosen <strong>free MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, upload the file that you want to convert! For our example converter, it’s as simple as dragging and dropping your chosen MP3 into the interface (as pointed out in the image below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%201.png"
                      alt="Launch MP3 to MP4 Converter"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>Once the MP3 file has been uploaded, choose your desired output format.</p>
<p>(For our example <strong>MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, this means selecting the settings icon for the file in question and then choosing a format from the pop-up window that appears (shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%202.png"
                      alt="Choose MP4 Output Format"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Start Converting!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen your desired output format (which in this case is <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong>), select the “CONVERT” button to finish up!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Convert MP3 into MP4"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save MP3 Into MP4</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your chosen <strong>free MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.</p>
<p>In the case of EaseUS Video Converter, it is downloaded automatically, all you have to do is select the “Finished” tab and select “OPEN” to go directly to the file location.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="02How-to-Convert-MP3-to-MOV"><a href="#02How-to-Convert-MP3-to-MOV" class="headerlink" title="02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?"></a>02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?</h3><p>We’ve also included how you can convert <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong> with the same tool! As you will surely see, much of the process is the same. Only one step is really changed!</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Uploaded MP3 File!</strong></p>
<p>First, just like in the previous section, upload your MP3 file (by dragging and dropping the file onto the <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong> converter.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%205.png"
                      alt="Choose Files for Upload"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select ‘MOV’ Format!</strong></p>
<p>This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the “MOV” format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%206.png"
                      alt="Select MOV output format"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Convert!</strong></p>
<p>Again, just like before, select “CONVERT” to start the conversion process from <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong>!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%207.png"
                      alt="Select Conver or Convert All"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Open Folder to Find File!</strong></p>
<p>Then, finally, go to the “Finished” tab to find your new MOV file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

A link to a video showing how the converter works, as well as brief descriptions for each converter, have also been provided to ensure that you have a good idea of how each one works!</p>
<h3 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="01**Wondershare Filmora**"></a>01**<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>**</h3><p>The first of the tools on this list is Filmora! Filmora, first and foremost, is an advanced video editor. Some might say that using it as a tool to simply convert <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> is a little bit of an overkill.</p>
<p>But, chances are, you’re not likely going to want to stop at converting your MP3 into an MP4 file anyway, right? Well, if that’s the case, then having an all-in-one tool on your side that can offer you endless options for all sorts of purposes is one way to ensure that you are starting off on the right foot from the very beginning!</p>
<h3 id="02Zamzar"><a href="#02Zamzar" class="headerlink" title="02Zamzar"></a>02Zamzar</h3><p>Zamzar is a Windows 10 app that works as a general conversion tool. It doesn’t just convert <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> or <strong>MP3 into MOV</strong> — it also does the job if you’re looking for a converter that will work on JPG to PNG or PDF to JPG, etc. That makes it a helpful tool to have on hand just for general conversion purposes.</p>
<h3 id="03Online-File-Converter"><a href="#03Online-File-Converter" class="headerlink" title="03Online File Converter"></a>03Online File Converter</h3><p>Online File Converter, as you can probably guess from the name, is an online conversion tool! This tool, much like Zamzar, is a heavy-hitter when it comes to conversion inputs and outputs compatibility. So, not only are you able to do the general <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> conversion promised today, but you can do other things as well! Plus, no download or installation is required! All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.</p>
<h3 id="04Any-Conv"><a href="#04Any-Conv" class="headerlink" title="04Any Conv"></a>04Any Conv</h3><p>AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you’re looking for an online solution, but you don’t like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="05Uniconverter"><a href="#05Uniconverter" class="headerlink" title="05Uniconverter"></a>05Uniconverter</h3><p>Uniconverter is an online <strong>MP3 to MP4</strong> tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It’s a very solid tool. And it’s quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.</p>
<h3 id="06MConverter-Chrome-Extension"><a href="#06MConverter-Chrome-Extension" class="headerlink" title="06MConverter - Chrome Extension"></a>06MConverter - Chrome Extension</h3><p>Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we’re delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Despite the variety of options out there for <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong> instead — that’s possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert <strong>MP4 to MP3</strong>, that works too!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.</p>

<p>For our example, we’ll be using the <strong>free MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, EaseUS Video Converter! This is open-source software, so you can use it for free!</p>
<p>To start using your chosen <strong>free MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, upload the file that you want to convert! For our example converter, it’s as simple as dragging and dropping your chosen MP3 into the interface (as pointed out in the image below.)</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>Once the MP3 file has been uploaded, choose your desired output format.</p>
<p>(For our example <strong>MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, this means selecting the settings icon for the file in question and then choosing a format from the pop-up window that appears (shown in the image below).</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Start Converting!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen your desired output format (which in this case is <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong>), select the “CONVERT” button to finish up!</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Save MP3 Into MP4</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your chosen <strong>free MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.</p>
<p>In the case of EaseUS Video Converter, it is downloaded automatically, all you have to do is select the “Finished” tab and select “OPEN” to go directly to the file location.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select ‘MOV’ Format!</strong></p>
<p>This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the “MOV” format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.</p>

A link to a video showing how the converter works, as well as brief descriptions for each converter, have also been provided to ensure that you have a good idea of how each one works!</p>
<h3 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="01**Wondershare Filmora**"></a>01**<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>**</h3><p>The first of the tools on this list is Filmora! Filmora, first and foremost, is an advanced video editor. Some might say that using it as a tool to simply convert <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> is a little bit of an overkill.</p>
<p>But, chances are, you’re not likely going to want to stop at converting your MP3 into an MP4 file anyway, right? Well, if that’s the case, then having an all-in-one tool on your side that can offer you endless options for all sorts of purposes is one way to ensure that you are starting off on the right foot from the very beginning!</p>
<h3 id="02Zamzar-3"><a href="#02Zamzar-3" class="headerlink" title="02Zamzar"></a>02Zamzar</h3><p>Zamzar is a Windows 10 app that works as a general conversion tool. It doesn’t just convert <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> or <strong>MP3 into MOV</strong> — it also does the job if you’re looking for a converter that will work on JPG to PNG or PDF to JPG, etc. That makes it a helpful tool to have on hand just for general conversion purposes.</p>
<h3 id="03Online-File-Converter-3"><a href="#03Online-File-Converter-3" class="headerlink" title="03Online File Converter"></a>03Online File Converter</h3><p>Online File Converter, as you can probably guess from the name, is an online conversion tool! This tool, much like Zamzar, is a heavy-hitter when it comes to conversion inputs and outputs compatibility. So, not only are you able to do the general <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> conversion promised today, but you can do other things as well! Plus, no download or installation is required! All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.</p>
<h3 id="04Any-Conv-3"><a href="#04Any-Conv-3" class="headerlink" title="04Any Conv"></a>04Any Conv</h3><p>AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you’re looking for an online solution, but you don’t like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="05Uniconverter-3"><a href="#05Uniconverter-3" class="headerlink" title="05Uniconverter"></a>05Uniconverter</h3><p>Uniconverter is an online <strong>MP3 to MP4</strong> tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It’s a very solid tool. And it’s quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.</p>
<h3 id="06MConverter-Chrome-Extension-3"><a href="#06MConverter-Chrome-Extension-3" class="headerlink" title="06MConverter - Chrome Extension"></a>06MConverter - Chrome Extension</h3><p>Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we’re delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Despite the variety of options out there for <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong> instead — that’s possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert <strong>MP4 to MP3</strong>, that works too!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.</p>

How to Use Stop Motion Studio?</h2><p>With the help of Stop Motion Studio, you can make animation by combining multiple pictures. You need to download Stop Motion Studio Pro for your iOS or Android device to use the app. You can also download it for PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="download stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Once you have downloaded the app, install it to work on your animation project right away. To create a new movie, click on the plus icon to create a new movie.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-movie-in-stop-motion-studio.jpg"
                      alt="adding new movie in stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="changing frame rate on stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Stop-Motion-Studio-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Stop-Motion-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Use Stop Motion Studio?"></a>Part 2. How to Use Stop Motion Studio?</h2><p>With the help of Stop Motion Studio, you can make animation by combining multiple pictures. You need to download Stop Motion Studio Pro for your iOS or Android device to use the app. You can also download it for PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="download stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Once you have downloaded the app, install it to work on your animation project right away. To create a new movie, click on the plus icon to create a new movie.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-movie-in-stop-motion-studio.jpg"
                      alt="adding new movie in stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="changing frame rate on stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>

<p>Step 1: Once you have downloaded the app, install it to work on your animation project right away. To create a new movie, click on the plus icon to create a new movie.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding new movie in stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/changing-frame-rate-on-stop-motion-studio.jpg"
                      alt="changing frame rate on stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>

                      alt="exporting file on stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: You are done!! Yes, it was that simple and easy to create a great stop motion video yourself.</p>
<p>If you want to make a basic video and add audio, the Stop Motion Studio free version is ideal for you. But if you’re going to explore more app features, you need to buy Stop Motion Studio Pro Windows, a paid version of the app.</p>
