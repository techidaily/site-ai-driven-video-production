You can either use an MP3 file or record your own voice to make the soundtrack for the video. The app offers advanced video recording options, so you can pause and resume shooting at any moment or use the Start Timer option to give yourself time to prepare before the recording starts.

The app’s video editor lets you apply effects, add frames and text overlays, while you can also import as many as sixty photos from your camera roll and turn them into an HD video.</p><p>However, the Music Video Maker is primarily a photo editor, which means that it lacks some of the frequently used effects that are commonly used in music videos that are posted on TikTok and other similar platforms.

However, for parents, this adds a reassuring level of moderation and support. Every video is moderated before it is shared. The set-up of the account is not too arduous. You are asked for your home country, your email address and your date of birth. All your videos will be anonymised as part of a stringent adherence to GDPR and safeguarding policies. The strength of this app is the infrastructure of a large brand that understands how to protect children. Be aware, your movie will become the property of the Lego group when uploaded.</p><p>Probably the most attractive selling point of this app is that there is no third-party advertising.

You can also export your video with OnionCam 2.</p><p> The “onion” in the title comes from the onion-skin function which allows you to check the lapse between photographs. There is a translucent display of the picture you took last time – allowing you to gradually build up your time-lapse movie.</p><p>The guidelines are also a useful way to measure the changes you are making.</p><p>If you want an app that allows you to create a simple movie without too many bells and whistles, then this is the app for you.

If you have both vital qualities, read on to understand how to maximise the effects in your film.</p><h3 id="1-Get-your-timing-right"><a href="#1-Get-your-timing-right" class="headerlink" title="1. Get your timing right"></a>1. Get your timing right</h3><p>If you want your characters to move quickly, then you need fewer images and movements per second. If you’re going to slow the characters down, you need to take more pictures with more actions. Getting this right is a matter of trial and error, to begin with.</p><p>However, you can make this easier for yourself by planning a little. If you have a shooting rate of 15-frames per second, then you will need to plan out 15 images to fill a second of film. Each action in your movie that would last a second will need 15 pictures with gradual changes per image.</p><h3 id="2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural"><a href="#2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural" class="headerlink" title="2. Making your characters’ movements natural"></a>2. Making your characters’ movements natural</h3><p>If you are not careful, your characters will move around in a jerky fashion. In real life, we ease in and ease out of actions. We start and finish an action slowly. Therefore, when taking images, use more pictures at the start and end of a movement, giving the impression of easing in and out of actions.</p><h3 id="3-Master-the-walk-cycle"><a href="#3-Master-the-walk-cycle" class="headerlink" title="3. Master the walk cycle"></a>3. Master the walk cycle</h3><p>A great place to start your Lego movie-making is in the perfection of the walk. Your characters will go through 4 movements in a walk.</p><ul><li>One leg will step forward, heel down, and toe up.</li><li>The toe on this foot then descends</li><li>The other leg passes the standing leg</li><li>The passing leg heel hits the floor</li></ul><p>This movement will likely take about 20 frames. When moving the arms, make sure the opposite arms move with the leg – so the left arm swings as the right leg is moving forward.</p><h3 id="4-Practice-and-perfect"><a href="#4-Practice-and-perfect" class="headerlink" title="4. Practice and perfect"></a>4. Practice and perfect</h3><p>Finally, watch how people move in real life. Notice how the heads, arms, and legs move together. Then, try to recreate this with your Lego characters. Watch your material, reflect on what could be improved, and try again. The only way to become a great Lego movie maker is to practice, practice, and practice some more!</p><hr><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>Finding ways to produce content that stands out on social media is becoming increasingly difficult as video content is growing more popular.

Here are seven basic production rules:</p><ul><li>Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background “spilling” around their body or shoulders.</li><li>In general, don’t cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.</li><li>The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.</li><li>The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.</li><li>There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.</li><li>Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.</li><li>Don’t worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.</li></ul><h2 id="Setting-up-the-Key"><a href="#Setting-up-the-Key" class="headerlink" title="Setting up the Key"></a>Setting up the Key</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 01"                ></p><p>The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Select the green screen clip</strong></p><p>From the <strong>Effects Browser &gt; Keying</strong> category, double-click the <strong>Keyer</strong> effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 02"                ></p><p>Don’t panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 03"                ></p><p>Click the <strong>Sample Color</strong> icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 04"                ></p><p>In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.</p><p>Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:</p><ul><li>Cleaning up the matte</li><li>Edge adjustments</li><li>Light wrap</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 06"                ></p><p>Click the <strong>Matte</strong> button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 07"                ></p><p>Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the <strong>Fill Holes</strong> and <strong>Edge Distance</strong> sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you’ll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 05"                ></p><p>If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the <strong>Edges</strong> icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 09"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Tweaks Video</strong></p><p>Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 09a"                ></p><p>Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:</p><ul><li>Color Selection</li><li>Matte Tools</li><li>Spill Suppression</li><li>Light Wrap</li></ul><p>The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)</p><p>Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more “organic,” as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.</p><p>This is a subtle effect, but very cool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 10"                ></p><p>Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-11.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 11"                ></p><p>When you are done, you have a great looking key!</p><h2 id="Clean-up-the-Image-with-a-Garbage-Mask"><a href="#Clean-up-the-Image-with-a-Garbage-Mask" class="headerlink" title="Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask"></a>Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-12.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 12"                ></p><p>Sometimes, however, you don’t have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)</p><p>Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there’s one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 13"                ></p><p>Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn’t all that good – drag the Mask effect (<strong>Effects &gt; Keying &gt; Mask</strong>) on top of the green-screen clip.</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg"                      alt="fx chroma 14"                ></p><p>Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I’ve found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.</p><p>However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That’s where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It’s written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com&#x2F;fcpx&#x2F; – I recommend his effects highly.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Chroma-Key-in-easier-ways"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Chroma-Key-in-easier-ways" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Chroma-Key in easier ways?"></a>How to Create a Chroma-Key in easier ways?</h2><p>Chroma-key, or green screen, is an essential part of every editor to make all kinds of effects.

This should come as no surprise as most of our photos and footage are stored on mobile devices, while apps like PowerDirector give the full functionality of a professional editing suite on mobile technology.</p><p>Currently PowerDirector is only available on Android, but if you’re using an iOS device you’re sadly missing out. Luckily there are several alternative apps that allow you to edit your footage from a mobile device; see our reviews below.</p><h2 id="Best-PowerDirector-Alternatives-for-Android-and-iOS-1"><a href="#Best-PowerDirector-Alternatives-for-Android-and-iOS-1" class="headerlink" title="Best PowerDirector Alternatives for Android and iOS"></a>Best PowerDirector Alternatives for Android and iOS</h2><h4 id="1-Kinemaster"><a href="#1-Kinemaster" class="headerlink" title="1. Kinemaster"></a>1. Kinemaster</h4><p>System: Android, iOS</p><p>Kinemaster is an impressive app that brings simplicity to complex professional editing tools, making it easy to use even on a small screen. It supports multiple layers including unlimited text, handwriting and sticker layers, as well as up to two video layers and four additional audio tracks. The precision editing features allow you edit frame by frame and it’s easy to quickly import extra footage and add additional effects. With a host of other features we haven’t mentioned it’s amazing how simple this app is. The only downside is the pricing model; instead of a one-off payment you’re saddled with £2.91 per month, an investment that could end up exceeding the value of the app.</p><h4 id="2-LumaFX"><a href="#2-LumaFX" class="headerlink" title="2. LumaFX"></a>2. LumaFX</h4><p>System: iOS</p><p>LumaFX is a treasure trove of editing effects and goodies, allowing you to completely change the look of your video. The colour and FX sections of the app have a variety of filters and presets that allow you to do anything from fixing annoying colours to transforming your video into a psychedelic cartoon. The versatility of crop tools is also incredibly impressive, allowing you to crop your clip to different aspect ratios that can then be can be flipped and rotated, slowed down, reversed, and trimmed. Even if you decide on another more powerful editing app, the low cost and range of features of LumaFX makes it ideal for using in conjunction with your app of choice to produce the ultimate video content.</p><h4 id="3-iMovie-–-Free"><a href="#3-iMovie-–-Free" class="headerlink" title="3. iMovie – Free"></a>3. iMovie – Free</h4><p>System: iOS</p><p>Every iOS user should be familiar with iMovie as it comes bundled on every apple device. Costing nothing is a big upside, especially when the technology handles as intuitively as it does. Splicing footage becomes laughably easy. On the audio side you can add music and personalised voiceovers to your videos and if you’re in the mood for something a little silly there are plenty of over the top TV templates and movie style themes. Accessibility is a big plus for iMovie, but it’s definitely geared to more casual users – professionals will find high end features lacking and should consider a more powerful paid alternative.</p><h4 id="4-Adobe-Premiere-Clip"><a href="#4-Adobe-Premiere-Clip" class="headerlink" title="4. Adobe Premiere Clip"></a>4. Adobe Premiere Clip</h4><p>System: Android, iOS</p><p>Another free offering, Adobe Premiere Clip shares many of both the benefits and flaws of iMovie. For the casual user its ideal, offering a straightforward means of arranging clips that’s predominantly designed for speed. The creative cloud allows you to continue editing on the desktop Premiere Pro making it a handy extension for existing Adobe customers. It’s also a much more compact download than iMovie; 91 MB compared to 600. There’s a standard array of editing features including trimming and a basic title editor, as well as the option to export options to social sharing sites of your choice, but unless you already work within the creative cloud there’s limited reasons to choose this over the superior iMovie.</p><p>There really is no beating PowerDirector for Android, but iOS users should be able to find an app or combination of apps to allow them to continue editing on the move.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-intro-magic-10-best-online-maker-tools/"><u>New 2024 Approved Intro Magic 10 Best Online Maker Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-creme-de-la-creme-of-4k-video-content/"><u>New 2024 Approved The Crème De La Crème of 4K Video Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-unlimited-free-face-creation-top-online-resources/"><u>New Unlimited Free Face Creation Top Online Resources</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-best-free-mpeg-video-concatenation-software/"><u>Updated Best Free MPEG Video Concatenation Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-the-most-accessible-video-editors-for-beginners/"><u>New The Most Accessible Video Editors for Beginners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-are-you-wondering-youtube-audio-download-procedure-heres-your-quick-yet-stunning-guide-on-youtube-2-mp3-conversion-for-2024/"><u>New Are You Wondering YouTube Audio Download Procedure?

It is a simplified version of the MP4 format and was designed to make file sizes smaller so mobile phones could support video. In this article, we will introduce a very easy-to-use tool: Wondershare 3GP cutter and splitter, which can be used to split large 3GP video clips into smaller files, or to extract key messages from any videos with a .3gp extension. Follow the steps we are about to outline and you will have no issues with your 3GP video cutting experience.</p><p>To get started, download and install this smart 3GP cutter -<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora (for Win and Mac) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. And then follow the step-by-step tutorial below to chop your 3GP files.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h3 id="How-to-cut-3gp-file-with-Wondershare-Filmora-originally-Wondershare-Video-Editor"><a href="#How-to-cut-3gp-file-with-Wondershare-Filmora-originally-Wondershare-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="How to cut 3gp file with Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)"></a>How to cut 3gp file with Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)</h3><h4 id="1-Add-3GP-files-to-Wondershare-3GP-cutting-tool"><a href="#1-Add-3GP-files-to-Wondershare-3GP-cutting-tool" class="headerlink" title="1.  Add 3GP files to Wondershare 3GP cutting tool"></a>1.  Add 3GP files to Wondershare 3GP cutting tool</h4><p>There are two different ways for you to add 3GP files to this 3GP splitter. Hit the “Import” button on the main menu of the interface to browse your computer and then import your wanted 3GP files to this app’s album. Or you can also add your files by directly dragging and dropping them into this app’s album.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-video-1.jpg"                      alt="3GP splitter"                ></p><h4 id="2-Cut-3GP-video-clips"><a href="#2-Cut-3GP-video-clips" class="headerlink" title="2 Cut 3GP video clips"></a>2 Cut 3GP video clips</h4><p>Drag one of the source 3GP files from the album to the timeline at the bottom. And then move the top of the red Time Indicator to put it at one point you want, click the scissor-like icon, move the Time Indicator to another point, and hit the scissor icon again. In this way, you can split the 3GP file into several clips.</p><p>If you want to chop a big 3GP file into several small-size files, at this time, you need to save the whole project for backup purpose. Then, import the saved project again and again to delete redundant clips to just export the only one into a single file each time.</p><p>But if you want to cut out some unwanted segments or to extract some parts you want, just hit the clips you don’t want and click the “Delete” icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/cut-steps.jpg"                      alt="cut 3gp file"                ></p><h4 id="3-Export-the-rest-3GP-clips"><a href="#3-Export-the-rest-3GP-clips" class="headerlink" title="3 Export the rest 3GP clips"></a>3 Export the rest 3GP clips</h4><p>When everything is done, just press the “Create” button to export the new file. At this time, a pop-up window will pop up to let you select an output method. If you still want to keep the file in 3GP format, just go to Format category and choose 3GP as the output format. After that, you can find the output file according to the output path.<br>Wondershare 3GP Cutter and splitter also lets you to directly upload to any of those popular video sharing sites such as Youtube, Facebook, Vimeo etc. or to export to any popular mobile devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-output.jpg"                      alt="export 3gp"                ></p><p>Also check out below video tutorial on how to cut&#x2F;trim&#x2F;split 3GP files step by step:</p><h3 id="Second-part-other-free-3GP-cutters-for-users"><a href="#Second-part-other-free-3GP-cutters-for-users" class="headerlink" title="Second part, other free 3GP cutters for users"></a>Second part, other free 3GP cutters for users</h3><p>Wondershare 3GP Cutter allows you to not only cut or trim your 3GP videos, but also offers you a variety of other cool editing features so that you are able to easily make Hollywood-like movies at the ease of your home. If however, you are just looking for some free and simple 3GP Cutting tools, say you don’t have any other editing needs, then these following free 3GP cutters will be worth your consideration. We’ve listed three of them which we consider as the best for your reference.</p><h4 id="2-Free-Video-Cutter"><a href="#2-Free-Video-Cutter" class="headerlink" title="2.) Free Video Cutter"></a>2.) Free Video Cutter</h4><p>Free Video Cutter is a free cutting tool which enables you to cut your 3GP video with ease. Not only does the software support 3GP but it can also cope with several other video formats. The cutting process itself is simple, it takes into account audio and even subtitles and lets you worry only about the precise point you wish to cut your video, as a good cutting application should do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/free-video-cutter.png"                      alt="Free Video Cutter"                ></p><h4 id="3-Moo0-Video-Cutter"><a href="#3-Moo0-Video-Cutter" class="headerlink" title="3.) Moo0 Video Cutter"></a>3.) Moo0 Video Cutter</h4><p>Another very easy to use program which supports 3GP. It creates a copy of the section you want to cut and retained, leaving you worry free to do what you wish with the original file. Video formats supported are less than Free Video Cutter. Be sure to check if your original file is supported if you are cutting video clips other than 3GP.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/moo0.png"                      alt="Moo0 Video Cutter"                ></p><h4 id="4-Weeny-Free-Video-Cutter"><a href="#4-Weeny-Free-Video-Cutter" class="headerlink" title="4.) Weeny Free Video Cutter"></a>4.) Weeny Free Video Cutter</h4><p>This program adds another useful talent to the mix, being able to convert cuts to another format on the fly, and even adjust frame rates, audio settings and so on. As you may expect, with these added features the interface of this video cutter is a little busier, but it is still straightforward to operate and anyone can start cutting videos within five minutes of starting to use it. A well featured piece of software than can cut your 3GP files and many other video formats too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/weeny.jpg"                      alt="Weeny Free Video Cutter"                ></p><p>These are the best 3GP Cutters we recommend for you.

Luckily, currently, there is a large number of online video editors available that can offer a solid video editing experience to users who would like to piece their video clips together into visually attractive content.</p><p>If you want more decent editing, check out and click the download button right here:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Run Windows and Mac OS Video Editing Apps on Your Chromebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Android Video Editor Apps for Chromebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><hr><h2 id="Best-Online-Video-Editors-for-Chromebook-1"><a href="#Best-Online-Video-Editors-for-Chromebook-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Online Video Editors for Chromebook"></a>Best Online Video Editors for Chromebook</h2><p>In such abundance of different online video editors, most Chromebook owners will find themselves wondering, which online video editor is the best for me.

You can now edit your photos and videos more precisely using a big screen on your desktop and take advantage of fast processing. If you haven’t used the GoPro Quik pc version and you want to know what this app can do for you, then you are on the right page.</p><p>In this article, we will do a brief review of the GoPro Quik Desktop app. We will take a look at its features.

So, if you want to know about GoPro Quik in-depth, make sure you read the full article.</p><h2 id="GoPro-Quik-PC-An-Overview"><a href="#GoPro-Quik-PC-An-Overview" class="headerlink" title="GoPro Quik PC- An Overview"></a><strong>GoPro Quik PC- An Overview</strong></h2><p>Do you need an app for editing GoPro videos and photos? If the answer is yes, then you should go for GoPro Quik for Desktop. GoPro Quik is a video editing software that allows you to edit your GoPro videos and photos within no time.

The process is pretty quick, as the name suggests.</p><h2 id="GoPro-Quik-Windows-Features"><a href="#GoPro-Quik-Windows-Features" class="headerlink" title="GoPro Quik Windows Features"></a><strong>GoPro Quik Windows Features</strong></h2><p>GoPro Quik app is rich with features, and it provides pretty much everything that you need to create amazing photos and videos. A few highlighting features are discussed below:</p><h3 id="1-Create-Amazing-Videos-In-Just-A-Few-Clicks"><a href="#1-Create-Amazing-Videos-In-Just-A-Few-Clicks" class="headerlink" title="1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks"></a>1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks</h3><p>With GoPro Quik, making amazing videos is very easy. With just a few clicks, you can import all your videos and photos. Then you can edit them in just a few clicks. Everything here is so simple that you will feel like a pro video editor yourself.</p><h3 id="2-Auto-Cloud-Uploads"><a href="#2-Auto-Cloud-Uploads" class="headerlink" title="2.Auto Cloud Uploads"></a>2.Auto Cloud Uploads</h3><p>Another amazing feature of GoPro Quik is that once you have done editing your videos, they will be automatically uploaded to your cloud. But for this feature to work, make sure that you have an active GoPro PLUS subscription.</p><h3 id="3-Excellent-editing"><a href="#3-Excellent-editing" class="headerlink" title="3.Excellent editing"></a>3.Excellent editing</h3><p>Simply click a few buttons to turn GoPro footage into an awesome video. Pick the perfect soundtrack, then pick your favorite moments. Your video automatically syncs with the music, so you can share it in just a few seconds. Make your videos come alive with panning effects by adding photos and time-lapse sequences.</p><h3 id="4-Share-with-friends"><a href="#4-Share-with-friends" class="headerlink" title="4.Share with friends"></a>4.Share with friends</h3><p>Make short videos that are ideal for posting on Facebook, YouTube, and more. Make a unique video from your burst and timelapse photos. Additionally, you can find and save the most memorable moments in a video, then share them as high-quality still images.</p><h3 id="5-New-Speed-Tool"><a href="#5-New-Speed-Tool" class="headerlink" title="5.New Speed Tool"></a>5.New Speed Tool</h3><p>Tap the pencil to choose the Speed icon for the video in your Media Mural. Then you can apply more than one-speed effect simultaneously. The speed can be toggled between real-time and half-speed slow motion. You can also add freeze frames for a specified period of time.</p><h3 id="6-GoPro-Exclusive-filters"><a href="#6-GoPro-Exclusive-filters" class="headerlink" title="6.GoPro-Exclusive filters"></a>6.GoPro-Exclusive filters</h3><p>From Media or Mural, select a photo or video and tap the pencil. In order to optimize the footage to the environment it was shot in, GoPro has created 25 filters in-house. By using the scrub bar, you can adjust the intensity of each filter.</p><h3 id="7-Premium-Themes"><a href="#7-Premium-Themes" class="headerlink" title="7.Premium Themes"></a>7.Premium Themes</h3><p>Alternatively, you may create a new highlight from Media.

Besides adding text and transitions, you can also change the music, choose the duration, and choose the right format for your intended sharing platform, such as social media or text.</p><h5 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Despite its ease and quickness, there are a few drawbacks to it. First, I must say this is awesome and perfect for anyone who has never edited a GoPro video before. When you’re new to video editing software, it can be very easy to become frustrated and overwhelmed, so it’s great for those who aren’t familiar with it. It’s all about getting that video off your memory card and putting it out there. That’s it.</p><h5 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>You cannot edit footage from your phone or DSLR with Quik App for Desktop - only GoPro footage can be used in Quik App. This is a GoPro app, after all. It should be used with GoPro content!</p><p>In addition to the ten free songs, GoPro Plus members have access to an additional song library.

One can just drag the level line and move it up or down for adjusting the dB of any given clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-1.png"                      alt="Clip-level audio editing"                ></p><p>The job of the tiny white points on the right and left side of the clip is to apply the fade in and fade out effect on the audio. The left sided point can be dragged to the right to mark the ending of the fade-in effect of the clip. The right point has to be dragged left to set the start of the fade-out point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-2.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Related Article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to fade in&#x2F;out audio in Final Cut Pro &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> In this level, any effects and adjustments in audio are applicable for the entire clip including the audio channels within it. All the adjustments in the individual audio channels made by you would be preserved by FCP. This implies that when one reduces the volume for just one channel but increases the volume of the entire clip, then the single channel’s volume is only raised in proportion to the volume of the other channels. Ideally, you should do your edits at the clip-level when you have only one or two audio channels on your video clip.</p><h4 id="Section-2-Advanced-Audio-Editing"><a href="#Section-2-Advanced-Audio-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: Advanced Audio Editing"></a>Section 2: Advanced Audio Editing</h4><p>The audio of the video can be detached for editing the audio file separately. The Audio Inspector of FCP provides you with all precise controls of audio edit like pan, effect, volume, equalization and audio configuration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-3.png"                      alt="The Audio Inspector"                ></p><p>In order to detach the audio, you need to go to <strong>Clip</strong> &gt; <strong>Detach Audio</strong>. Or you can just right-click on the video file and click on Detach audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-4.png"                      alt="Detach audio"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a fine difference between ‘Detach Audio’ and ‘Expand Audio’. In Expand Audio, the audio clip is synced with the video. For instance, while moving the audio to the timeline, the video clip would also go with it. In case of detaching audio however the audio file would remain as a standalone clip that can be inserted into any portion of the video.</p><p>The Audio Inspector would allow you to apply the following effects:</p><ul><li>The volume can be increased by dragging the handle on the right side and lowered by dragging it towards the left.</li><li>Audio Equalization would allow the user to apply various effects (bass, loudness, boost, etc.) on the audio clip. It can also be adjusted by using the in-built audio equalizer.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-5.png"                      alt="Audio Equalization"                ></p><ul><li>Pan- Users can select from a number of Pan modes like surround sound or stereo. When you select ‘surround’, Final Cut Pro would provide you with a <strong>Surround Panner</strong> which would allow you to fine-tune the effects by moving the white point.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-6.png"                      alt="Pan"                ></p><ul><li>Effects- for this option one needs to go to the effects browser of the <strong>Audio Inspector</strong> or just hit comd5. This would allow you to choose many different audio effects such as echo, distortion, spaces and much more. Just double-click on any effect to find a range of editing options.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-7.png"                      alt="Effects"                ></p><ul><li>Audio Configuration: The audio configuration tool would allow the user to modify the audio channel with mono, stereo, or reverse stereo.</li></ul><p><strong>Here’s the video tutorial on how to edit audios in Final Cut Pro:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ubuntu-video-editing-essentials-top-10-free-options/"><u>New 2024 Approved Ubuntu Video Editing Essentials Top 10 Free Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-10-websites-to-create-free-customizable-invitation-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Top 10 Websites to Create Free Customizable Invitation Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-face-obscuring-made-easy-expert-video-editing-solutions/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Face Obscuring Made Easy Expert Video Editing Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-audio-conversion-made-easy-12-essential-tools-you-need/"><u>New 2024 Approved Audio Conversion Made Easy 12 Essential Tools You Need</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-blur-video-online-for-free/"><u>In 2024, How to Blur Video Online for Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-6-intro-video-makers-for-stunning-movie-openers/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Top 6 Intro Video Makers for Stunning Movie Openers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-10-leading-intro-creator-platforms-free-and-paid-options-for-2024/"><u>New 10 Leading Intro Creator Platforms Free and Paid Options for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/cut-to-the-chase-filmora-coupon-codes-without-the-fuss/"><u>Cut to the Chase Filmora Coupon Codes Without the Fuss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/daily-dose-of-anime-joy-youtube-channel-rankings-new-list-2023/"><u>Daily Dose of Anime Joy  YouTube Channel Rankings, New List 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-5-frosty-yet-inviting-backdrops-for-your-vids/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  5 Frosty Yet Inviting Backdrops for Your Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-box-office-hype-films/"><u>2024 Approved  Ultimate Box Office Hype Films</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-transition-tactics-for-a-hassle-free-macos-11-big-sur-upgrade/"><u>[New] Transition Tactics for a Hassle-Free macOS 11 Big Sur Upgrade</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-mobile-audio-recordings-the-10-leading-iphone-apps/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Mobile Audio Recordings The 10 Leading iPhone Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-pioneering-camera-tech-an-analysis-of-manycams-new-recorder/"><u>[New] In 2024, Pioneering Camera Tech  An Analysis of ManyCam's New Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-the-error-of-unfortunately-the-processcomandroidphone-has-stopped-on-poco-m6-pro-4g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix the Error of Unfortunately the Process.com.android.phone Has Stopped on Poco M6 Pro 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-unlock-youtubes-enigmentic-video-cache/"><u>2024 Approved  How to Unlock YouTube’s Enigmentic Video Cache</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
