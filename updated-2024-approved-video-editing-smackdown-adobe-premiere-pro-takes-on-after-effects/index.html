<p>This is perhaps the most asked question regarding video processing on the internet. And looking at the product descriptions on the Adobe site gives us a clue why. There seems to be a large overlap between the two programs, and technically there is, although as we shall see capability doesn’t always mean suitability, so the similarities are not quite as pronounced as they would appear.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it is worth looking at the key differences between <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >After Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Premiere to get a clearer understanding of what is best for which situation and why you would pick one program over the other. So below are the 9 points that I will make a comparison.</p>

Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.</p>
<p>The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere’s timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.</p>

This is not surprising of course, Premiere is after all first and foremost an editing package. By contrast, whilst there is editing functionality within After Effects, it is neither as user friendly, nor remotely as comprehensive a tool set, and as such would not be a suitable environment for extensive editing workflow.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the crux of the differences between the two packages, for editing work Premiere offers a complete toolset far beyond the requirements for many projects, but as comprehensive as one wishes, whilst After Effects is focus more on composites and motion video work and has an editing tool set that is not conducive to efficiency and ease of use.</p>

Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.</p>
<p>The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere’s timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.</p>

<h4 id="2Editing-2"><a href="#2Editing-2" class="headerlink" title="2Editing"></a>2Editing</h4><p>In addition to the timeline, Premiere has an interface and toolset built for precise editing and clip manipulation, both audio and video. This is not surprising of course, Premiere is after all first and foremost an editing package. By contrast, whilst there is editing functionality within After Effects, it is neither as user friendly, nor remotely as comprehensive a tool set, and as such would not be a suitable environment for extensive editing workflow.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the crux of the differences between the two packages, for editing work Premiere offers a complete toolset far beyond the requirements for many projects, but as comprehensive as one wishes, whilst After Effects is focus more on composites and motion video work and has an editing tool set that is not conducive to efficiency and ease of use.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most asked question regarding video processing on the internet. And looking at the product descriptions on the Adobe site gives us a clue why. There seems to be a large overlap between the two programs, and technically there is, although as we shall see capability doesn’t always mean suitability, so the similarities are not quite as pronounced as they would appear.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it is worth looking at the key differences between <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >After Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Premiere to get a clearer understanding of what is best for which situation and why you would pick one program over the other. So below are the 9 points that I will make a comparison.</p>

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Save It with File Manager</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone’s storage.</p>
<p>Step 2: Open your <strong>File Manager app</strong>. Click on the hamburger icon (three dots) present on the right corner of the screen.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>

<p>Step 2: In order to save someone’s WhatsApp status, you must first view it in WhatsApp. After watching the status, open the Status Saver app.</p>
<p>Step 3: When you open it, you will see all the statuses you have seen on WhatsApp. Tap on the movie or image you wish to save, then click the download icon at the bottom. The share icon on the right allows you to share the status with WhatsApp contacts, Instagram, Facebook, and other networks.</p>

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Save It with File Manager</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone’s storage.</p>
<p>Step 2: Open your <strong>File Manager app</strong>. Click on the hamburger icon (three dots) present on the right corner of the screen.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Step 3: On the next screen of Settings, you can enable the option of show hidden files. Go to the internal storage of the device.</p>

                      alt="file manager whatsapp files"
                ></p>
<p> Step 4: Look for the WhatsApp folder, go to ‘Media’ and then click on the folder ‘.Statuses’</p>
<p><img

                      alt="file manager whatsapp statuses"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Save It with Third-Party App</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: First, download the app <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.downlood.sav.whmedia&hl=en_US&gl=US" >‘Status Saver – Downloader for WhatsApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.’ And open the app and grant it storage access.</p>
<p>Step 2: In order to save someone’s WhatsApp status, you must first view it in WhatsApp. After watching the status, open the Status Saver app.</p>
<p>Step 3: When you open it, you will see all the statuses you have seen on WhatsApp. Tap on the movie or image you wish to save, then click the download icon at the bottom. The share icon on the right allows you to share the status with WhatsApp contacts, Instagram, Facebook, and other networks.</p>

<p>It’s only possible for someone to see your status updates if both of you have each other’s phone numbers in your phone’s address book.

<p>The WhatsApp status feature allows the user to share pictures, text, videos, and GIFs on their account. The best part is that these disappear after 24 hours and are end-to-end encrypted.

<p>If you are involved in video editing or post-production activities, then you might be familiar with color matching. In this, we make sure that the overall color and tone of our videos are matched throughout. Thankfully, you can easily do color match in Final Cut Pro or any other reliable video editing tool. In this detailed Final Cut Pro match color tutorial, I will help you do the same and would also share details about its best alternative.</p>

If you want, you can use the automatic FCPX match color tool in the application to automatically apply the effect. Besides that, you can manually match color in Final Cut Pro X by using its inbuilt features.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Using the Final Cut Pro Match Color Tool</strong></p>
<p>To use the Final Cut Pro X Match Color feature, you can simply go through these simple steps:</p>
<p><em>Step 1: Load and import the video clips</em></p>
<p>To begin with, you can just launch Final Cut Pro on your Mac and go to its File &gt; Import &gt; Media to load any video clip of your choice. You can simply drag and drop your videos to the Final Cut Pro interface.</p>
<p><em>Step 2: Apply the FCPX Match Color effect</em></p>
<p>Now, simply select the clip you want to edit, go to the Enhancement menu, and click on the Match Color icon (below the viewer). You can also find it under the Modify &gt; Match Color option or get the feature by pressing the Option + Command + M key combination.</p>
<p>Afterward, the Color Match FCPX tool will display two different screens in the viewer. On the right, you would have the clip from where you can match the source while the target clip will be displayed on the left.</p>
<p>From the Final Cut Pro timeline or the browser, you can find the appropriate clips. If you want, you can even import a still image to source the respective colors for matching. Simply preview the changes that the FCPX Color Match tool will make and click on the “Apply Match” in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Adjust the Video Color Manually</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the match color tool in Final Cut, you can also manually set the color grading and saturation feature. While this will not get you instant or exact results to color match in Final Cut Pro, you can still give it a try.</p>
<p>Once the video clip is loaded on Filmora, just go to the Effects Browser &gt; Inspector and add the Color Correction effect to the video. Now, you can go to the Color Correction tab from the sidebar to manually adjust the value for color, saturation, and exposure to get the desired effects.</p>

<p>Mirrored Video</p>
